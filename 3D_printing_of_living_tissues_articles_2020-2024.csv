33585711	Additive manufacturing (AM) is among the most attractive methods to produce implants, the processes are very swift and it can be precisely controlled to meet patient's requirement since they can be produced in exact shape, dimension, and even texture of different living tissues. Until now, lots of methods have emerged and used in this field with diverse characteristics. This review aims to comprehensively discuss 3D printing (3DP) technologies to manufacture metallic implants, especially on techniques and procedures. Various technologies based on their main properties are categorized, the effecting parameters are introduced, and the history of AM technology is briefly analyzed. Subsequently, the utilization of these AM-manufactured components in medicine along with their effectual variables is discussed, and special attention is paid on to the production of porous scaffolds, taking pore size, density, etc., into consideration. Finally, 3DP of the popular metallic systems in medical applications such as titanium, Ti6Al4V, cobalt-chromium alloys, and shape memory alloys are studied. In general, AM manufactured implants need to comply with important requirements such as biocompatibility, suitable mechanical properties (strength and elastic modulus), surface conditions, custom-built designs, fast production, etc. This review aims to introduce the AM technologies in implant applications and find new ways to design more sophisticated methods and compatible implants that mimic the desired tissue functions.	3D Printing Technologies in Metallic Implants: A Thematic Review on the Techniques and Procedures.	2021		Attarilar Shokouh;Ebrahimi Mahmoud;Djavanroodi Faramarz;Fu Yuanfei;Wang Liqiang;Yang Junlin	3D printing techniques;Additive manufacturing;Biometals;Implants;Porous scaffolds		International journal of bioprinting	Department of Pediatric Orthopaedics, Xinhua Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University, School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.;State Key Laboratory of Metal Matrix Composites, School of Material Science and Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.;National Engineering Research Center of Light Alloy Net Forming, School of Materials Science and Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.;Department of Mechanical Engineering, College of Engineering, Prince Mohammad Bin Fahd University, Al Khobar, KSA.;Department of Mechanical Engineering, Imperial College London, London, UK.;Ninth People's Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai 200011, China.;State Key Laboratory of Metal Matrix Composites, School of Material Science and Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.;Department of Pediatric Orthopaedics, Xinhua Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University, School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.

33501353	The field of rehabilitation and assistive devices is being disrupted by innovations in desktop 3D printers and open-source designs. For upper limb prosthetics, those technologies have demonstrated a strong potential to aid those with missing hands. However, there are basic interfacing issues that need to be addressed for long term usage. The functionality, durability, and the price need to be considered especially for those in difficult living conditions. We evaluated the most popular designs of body-powered, 3D printed prosthetic hands. We selected a representative sample and evaluated its suitability for its grasping postures, durability, and cost. The prosthetic hand can perform three grasping postures out of the 33 grasps that a human hand can do. This corresponds to grasping objects similar to a coin, a golf ball, and a credit card. Results showed that the material used in the hand and the cables can withstand a 22 N normal grasping force, which is acceptable based on standards for accessibility design. The cost model showed that a 3D printed hand could be produced for as low as $19. For the benefit of children with congenital missing limbs and for the war-wounded, the results can serve as a baseline study to advance the development of prosthetic hands that are functional yet low-cost.

33376679	Bioprinting is a rapidly expanding technology with the ability to fabricate in vitro three-dimensional (3D) tissues in a layer-by-layer manner to ultimately produce a living tissue which physiologically resembles native in vivo tissue functionality. Unfortunately, large costs associated with commercially available bioprinters severely limit access to the technology. We investigated the potential for modifying a low-cost commercially available RepRap Prusa iteration 3 (i3) 3D printer with an open-source syringe-housed microextrusion print-head unit (universal paste extruder by Richard Horne, RichRap), that allowed for controlled deposition of cell-laden bioinks and Freeform Reversible Embedding of Suspended Hydrogels (FRESH) method-based printing.

35019604	"Three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting is a highly innovative and promising technology to render precise positioning of biologics together with living cells and extracellular matrix (ECM) constituents. In spite of such enthralling potential, the fabrication of a clinically relevant engineered tissue is quite challenging. A constellation of factors simulating the complex architecture of the native tissue, selection of the ""ideal bioink"", optimization of the biochemical, mechanical, and topographical functions of the cell-laden printed construct, cellular differentiation, their self-assembly, and remodeling into the desired lineage postprinting present major complications. Keeping this in view, we have attempted to highlight the use of silk fibroin (SF) protein from Bombyx mori silkworm as a promising biomaterial of choice for the formulation of bioink owing to its distinct characteristics involving rheology behavior, self-supporting filamentous extrusion, and a suitable biomaterial to achieve resolution printing. Further, we have elaborated on how SF gelatin bioink can in specific regulate the cellular differentiation pathway of progenitor cells, the mechanism of cellular self-assembly, cell migration, matrix remodeling, and self-orientation, leading to the desired tissue-specific construct. How features of bioink and fabrication design aspects can induce in vitro tissue patterning and anatomically relevant tissue organization have also been explored in this review. Importantly, we have tried to shift the understanding of bioprinted tissue regeneration from a cell-proliferation-centric and gene-expression-centric point of view to the complex role of the microenvironment present within the bioprinted constructs. We believe that shedding light on these factors would help in achieving the so-called ""ideal 3D bioprinted construct"" to meet the shortages of high-quality donor tissues for the regeneration of the damaged and diseased ones."

33325382	Additive manufacturing has shown promising results in reconstructing three-dimensional (3D) living tissues for various applications, including tissue engineering, regenerative medicine, drug discovery, and high-throughput drug screening. In extrusion-based bioprinters, stable formation of filaments and high-fidelity deposition of bioinks are the primary challenges in fabrication of physiologically relevant tissue constructs. Among various bioinks, gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) is known as a photocurable and physicochemically tunable hydrogel with a demonstrated biocompatibility and tunable biodegradation properties. The two-step crosslinking of GelMA (reversible thermal gelation and permanent photo-crosslinking) has attracted researchers to make complex tissue constructs. Despite promising results in filament formation and printability of this hydrogel, the effect of temperature on physicochemical properties, cytocompatibility, and biodegradation of the hydrogel are to be investigated. This work studies the effect of thermoreversible, physical crosslinking on printability of GelMA. The results of 3D printing of GelMA at different temperatures followed by irreversible chemical photo-crosslinking show that the decrease in temperature improves the filament formation and shape fidelity of the deposited hydrogel, particularly at the temperatures around 15 °C. Time dependant mechanical testing of the printed samples revealed that decreasing the extruding temperature increases the elastic properties of the extruded filaments. Furthermore, our novel approach in minimizing the slippage effect during rheological study enabled to measure changes in linear and non-linear viscoelastic properties of the printed samples at different temperatures. A considerable increase in storage modulus of the extruded samples printed at lower temperatures confirms their higher solid behavior. Scanning electron microscopy revealed a remarkable decrease in porosity of the extruded hydrogels by decreasing the temperature. Chemical analysis by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and circular dichroism showed a direct relationship between the coil-helix transition in hydrogel macromers and its physical alterations. Finally, biodegradation and cytocompatibility of the extruded hydrogels decreased at lower extruding temperatures.

33322291	Three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting technology has emerged as a powerful biofabrication platform for tissue engineering because of its ability to engineer living cells and biomaterial-based 3D objects. Over the last few decades, droplet-based, extrusion-based, and laser-assisted bioprinters have been developed to fulfill certain requirements in terms of resolution, cell viability, cell density, etc. Simultaneously, various bio-inks based on natural-synthetic biomaterials have been developed and applied for successful tissue regeneration. To engineer more realistic artificial tissues/organs, mixtures of bio-inks with various recipes have also been developed. Taken together, this review describes the fundamental characteristics of the existing bioprinters and bio-inks that have been currently developed, followed by their advantages and disadvantages. Finally, various tissue engineering applications using 3D bioprinting are briefly introduced.

33313504	The pipeline of antibiotics has been for decades on an alarmingly low level. Considering the steadily emerging antibiotic resistance, novel tools are needed for early and easy identification of effective anti-infective compounds. In Gram-negative bacteria, the uptake of anti-infectives is especially limited. We here present a surprisingly simple in vitro model of the Gram-negative bacterial envelope, based on 20% (w/v) potato starch gel, printed on polycarbonate 96-well filter membranes. Rapid permeability measurements across this polysaccharide hydrogel allowed to correctly predict either high or low accumulation for all 16 tested anti-infectives in living Escherichia coli. Freeze-fracture TEM supports that the macromolecular network structure of the starch hydrogel may represent a useful surrogate of the Gram-negative bacterial envelope. A random forest analysis of in vitro data revealed molecular mass, minimum projection area, and rigidity as the most critical physicochemical parameters for hydrogel permeability, in agreement with reported structural features needed for uptake into Gram-negative bacteria. Correlating our dataset of 27 antibiotics from different structural classes to reported MIC values of nine clinically relevant pathogens allowed to distinguish active from nonactive compounds based on their low in vitro permeability specifically for Gram-negatives. The model may help to identify poorly permeable antimicrobial candidates before testing them on living bacteria.

33301844	Local delivery of drugs, proteins and living cells with on demand release manner using porous scaffolds has been widely used in the field of tissue engineering and cancer therapies. Drugs directly loaded in the porous scaffolds, are generally prone to free diffuse especially for long term incubation. Herein, in this study, hollow fiber alginate/iron oxide nanoparticles scaffolds were prepared by coaxial 3D printing with drugs, protein or living cells encapsulating in the core part (low concentration of alginate gels). Magnetically-driven on demand release was realized by extruding the loaded drugs, proteins and cells from the core part of the hollow fibers due to the deformation of the scaffolds under magnetic field. Additionally, the hollow fibers could sever as diffusion barriers to reduce uncontrolled diffusion of drugs, proteins and cells from scaffolds in the conditions of no required stimulation. The factors influencing the deformation of the scaffolds, as well as the release behavior were investigated. The data indicated that the scaffolds prepared by 10 wt% of alginate with 13% of iron oxide nanoparticles after crosslinking using 0.1 M CaCl2 solution for 10 s showed repeated on demand release capability in vitro and in vivo under intermittently magnetic stimulation. Thus, this 3D printed alginate/iron oxide nanoparticles hollow scaffolds with on demand controlled delivery capability may prove useful for tissue engineering and disease therapies.

33264417	Bioprinting is a rapidly developing technology that enables the exact positioning of living cells embedded in bio-materials in precise spatial arrangements to fabricate engineered tissues and organs. While the ultimate goal of bio­printing approaches is to produce organs for transplantation purposes, bioprinted organ models also hold great potential for research purposes to serve as alternatives to animal experiments. By using human cells, humanized organ models can be generated that may produce more relevant results for human (patho-)physiology than animal models. However, standard bioprinting procedures currently use numerous hidden animal components. Virtually all studies published in the field to date make use of cells grown in media with fetal bovine serum (FBS). In addition, Matrigel, the extracellular matrix (ECM) harvested from Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm sarcoma grown in mice, is widely employed to cultivate stem cells and 3D organ models. Finally, most bioinks currently in use contain gelatin or comparable animal components to improve cell viability and adhesion. The present review will give an introduction to the potential of bioprinting to fabricate 3D models that may be substituted for animal experiments and will go on to describe strategies to replace animal components cur­rently included in standard procedures of bioprinting. These approaches comprise the adaptation of cells to FBS-free media, the use of bioinks composed of synthetic or plant material, and the replacement of animal ingredients by materials of human origin. We propose denoting bioprinting strategies devoid of animal components as clean bioprinting.

33244046	3D bioprinting of living cellular constructs with heterogeneity in cell types and extra cellular matrices (ECMs) matching those of biological tissues remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate that, through bioink material design, microextrusion-based (ME) bioprinting techniques have the potential to address this challenge. A new bioink employing alginate (1%), cellulose nanocrystal (CNC) (3%), and gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) (5%) (namely 135ACG hybrid ink) was formulated for the direct printing of cell-laden and acellular architectures. The 135ACG ink displayed excellent shear-thinning behavior and solid-like properties, leading to high printability without cell damage. After crosslinking, the ACG gel can also provide a stiff ECM ideal for stromal cell growth. By controlling the degree of substitution and polymer concentration, a GelMA (4%) bioink was designed to encapsulate hepatoma cells (hepG2), as GelMA gel possesses the desired low mechanical stiffness matching that of human liver tissue. Four different versions of to-scale liver lobule-mimetic constructs were fabricated via ME bioprinting, with precise positioning of two different cell types (NIH/3T3 and hepG2) embedded in matching ECMs (135ACG and GelMA, respectively). The four versions allowed us to exam effects of mechanical cues and intercellular interactions on cell behaviors. Fibroblasts thrived in stiff 135ACG matrix and aligned at the 135ACG/GelMA boundary due to durotaxis, while hepG2 formed spheroids exclusively in the soft GelMA matrix. Elevated albumin production was observed in the bicellular 3D co-culture of hepG2 and NIH/3T3, both with and without direct intercellular contact, indicating that improved hepatic cell function can be attributed to soluble chemical factors. Overall, our results showed that complex constructs with multiple cell types and varying ECMs can be bioprinted and potentially useful for both fundamental biomedical research and translational tissue engineering.	3D bioprinting of bicellular liver lobule-mimetic structures via microextrusion of cellulose nanocrystal-incorporated shear-thinning bioink.	2020	Nov	Wu Yun;Wenger Andrew;Golzar Hossein;Tang Xiaowu Shirley		Alginates;Animals;Biomimetics;Bioprinting;Cell Line;Cell Line, Tumor;Cell Proliferation;Cellulose;Extracellular Matrix;Fibroblasts;Gelatin;Hep G2 Cells;Hepatocytes;Humans;Ink;Liver;Mice;NIH 3T3 Cells;Nanoparticles;Printing, Three-Dimensional;Stromal Cells;Tissue Engineering;Tissue Scaffolds	Scientific reports	Department of Chemistry and Waterloo Institute for Nanotechnology, University of Waterloo, 200 University Ave West, Waterloo, ON, N2L 3G1, Canada.;Department of Chemistry and Waterloo Institute for Nanotechnology, University of Waterloo, 200 University Ave West, Waterloo, ON, N2L 3G1, Canada.;Department of Chemistry and Waterloo Institute for Nanotechnology, University of Waterloo, 200 University Ave West, Waterloo, ON, N2L 3G1, Canada.;Department of Chemistry and Waterloo Institute for Nanotechnology, University of Waterloo, 200 University Ave West, Waterloo, ON, N2L 3G1, Canada. tangxw@uwaterloo.ca.

33224121	Chemical gradients are surrounding living organisms in all habitats of life. Microorganisms, plants and animals have developed specific mechanisms to sense such gradients. Upon perception, chemical gradients can be categorized either as favorable, like nutrients or hormones, or as disadvantageous, resulting in a clear orientation toward the gradient and avoiding strategies, respectively. Being sessile organisms, fungi use chemical gradients for their orientation in the environment. Integration of this data enables them to successfully explore nutrient sources, identify probable plant or animal hosts, and to communicate during sexual reproduction or early colony development. We have developed a 3D printed device allowing a highly standardized, rapid and low-cost investigation of chemotropic growth processes in fungi. Since the 3D printed device is placed on a microscope slide, detailed microscopic investigations and documentation of the chemotropic process is possible.

33221501	Extrusion-based 3D printing followed by debinding and sintering is a powerful approach that allows for the fabrication of porous scaffolds from materials (or material combinations) that are otherwise very challenging to process using other additive manufacturing techniques. Iron is one of the materials that have been recently shown to be amenable to processing using this approach. Indeed, a fully interconnected porous design has the potential of resolving the fundamental issue regarding bulk iron, namely a very low rate of biodegradation. However, no extensive evaluation of the biodegradation behavior and properties of porous iron scaffolds made by extrusion-based 3D printing has been reported. Therefore, the in vitro biodegradation behavior, electrochemical response, evolution of mechanical properties along with biodegradation, and responses of an osteoblastic cell line to the 3D printed iron scaffolds were studied. An ink formulation, as well as matching 3D printing, debinding and sintering conditions, was developed to create iron scaffolds with a porosity of 67%, a pore interconnectivity of 96%, and a strut density of 89% after sintering. X-ray diffracometry confirmed the presence of the α-iron phase in the scaffolds without any residuals from the rest of the ink. Owing to the presence of geometrically designed macropores and random micropores in the struts, the in vitro corrosion rate of the scaffolds was much improved as compared to the bulk counterpart, with 7% mass loss after 28 days. The mechanical properties of the scaffolds remained in the range of those of trabecular bone despite 28 days of in vitro biodegradation. The direct culture of MC3T3-E1 preosteoblasts on the scaffolds led to a substantial reduction in living cell count, caused by a high concentration of iron ions, as revealed by the indirect assays. On the other hand, the ability of the cells to spread and form filopodia indicated the cytocompatibility of the corrosion products. Taken together, this study shows the great potential of extrusion-based 3D printed porous iron to be further developed as a biodegradable bone substituting biomaterial.

33213806	Comprehensive appreciation of the 3-dimensional anatomy of the living heart is essential for accurate diagnosis and establishment of safe interventional treatment by clinical electrophysiologists. Three-dimensional images displayed on a 2-dimensional surface usually undergo distortion and are not considered a real 3-dimensional representation because they cannot provide accurate depth perception. Currently, the availability of 3-dimensional visualization techniques, including 3-dimensional printing, 3-dimensional projectors, 3-dimensional monitors, and virtual reality, is limited owing to their limited user-friendliness and high costs. The authors discuss an alternative conventional approach of a cross-eyed method for viewing stereoscopically displayed images for better appreciation of real 3-dimensional images based on a simple technique.

38505627	One of the most common types of 3D printing technologies is inkjet printing due to its numerous advantages, including low cost, programmability, high resolution, throughput, and speed. Inkjet printers are also capable of fabricating artificial tissues with physiological characteristics similar to those of living tissues. These artificial tissues are used for disease modeling, drug discovery, drug screening, and replacements for diseased or damaged tissues. This paper reviews recent advancements in one of the most common 3D printing technologies, inkjet dispensing. We briefly consider common printing techniques, including fused deposition modeling (FDM), stereolithography (STL), and inkjet printing. We briefly discuss various steps in inkjet printing, including droplet generation, droplet ejection, interaction of droplets on substrates, drying, and solidification. We also discuss various parameters that affect the printing process, including ink properties (e.g., viscosity and surface tension), physical parameters (e.g., internal diameter of printheads), and actuation mechanisms (e.g., piezoelectric actuation and thermal actuation). Through better understanding of common 3D printing technologies and the parameters that influence the printing processes, new types of artificial tissues, disease models, and structures for drug discovery and drug screening may be prepared. This review considers future directions in inkjet printing research that are focused on enhancing the resolution, printability, and uniformity of printed structures.

33111943	Science education is most effective when it provides authentic experiences that reflect professional practices and approaches that address issues relevant to students' lives and communities. Such educational experiences are becoming increasingly interdisciplinary and can be enhanced using digital fabrication. Digital fabrication is the process of designing objects for the purpose of fabricating with machinery such as 3D-printers, laser cutters, and Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machines. Historically, these types of tools have been exceptionally costly and difficult to access; however, recent advancements in technological design have been accompanied by decreasing prices. In this review, we first establish the historical and theoretical foundations that support the use of digital fabrication as a pedagogical strategy to enhance learning. We specifically chose to focus attention on 3D-printing because this type of technology is becoming increasingly advanced, affordable, and widely available. We systematically reviewed the last 20 years of literature that characterized the use of 3D-printing in biological education, only finding a total of 13 articles that attempted to investigate the benefits for student learning. While the pedagogical value of student-driven creation is strongly supported by educational literature, it was challenging to make broad claims about student learning in relation to using or creating 3D-printed models in the context of biological education. Additional studies are needed to systematically investigate the impact of student-driven creation at the intersection of biology and engineering or computer science education.

33103357	3D printing is now popular in tissue engineering as it provides a facile route to the fabrication of scaffolds with/without living cells with a predesigned geometry. The properties of the ink constituents are critical for printing structures to meet both mechanical and biological requirements. Despite recent advances in ink development, it remains a challenge to print biopolymer based tough and elastic hydrogels. These hydrogels are in great demand as they can mimic the biomechanics of soft tissues such as skin, muscle, and cartilage. In this study, a catechol functionalized ink system is developed for 3D coaxial printing tough and elastic hydrogels. The ink is based on biopolymers including catechol modified hyaluronic acid (HACA) and alginate. A novel crosslinking strategy is proposed, involving simple ionic crosslinking, catechol mediated crosslinking, and Michael addition that are all induced under mild conditions. The HACA and alginate form a double network with high fracture toughness and elasticity, while proteins such as gelatin can be integrated with the HACA/alginate hydrogel during printing to improve cell interactions. The printed constructs demonstrate high cytocompatibility and support the differentiation of myoblasts into aligned myotubes. The catechol functionalized ink can be further modified to target various applications in soft tissue engineering.	3D Coaxial Printing Tough and Elastic Hydrogels for Tissue Engineering Using a Catechol Functionalized Ink System.	2020	Dec	Zhou Ying;Yue Zhilian;Chen Zhi;Wallace Gordon	3D printing;catechol functionalization;double network hydrogels;mouse myoblasts	Bioprinting;Catechols;Hydrogels;Ink;Printing, Three-Dimensional;Tissue Engineering;Tissue Scaffolds	Advanced healthcare materials	ARC Centre of Excellence for Electromaterials Science, Intelligent Polymer Research Institute, Innovation Campus, University of Wollongong, Wollongong, NSW, 2522, Australia.;ARC Centre of Excellence for Electromaterials Science, Intelligent Polymer Research Institute, Innovation Campus, University of Wollongong, Wollongong, NSW, 2522, Australia.;ARC Centre of Excellence for Electromaterials Science, Intelligent Polymer Research Institute, Innovation Campus, University of Wollongong, Wollongong, NSW, 2522, Australia.;ARC Centre of Excellence for Electromaterials Science, Intelligent Polymer Research Institute, Innovation Campus, University of Wollongong, Wollongong, NSW, 2522, Australia.

33092184	The development of artificial tissue/organs with the functional maturity of their native equivalents is one of the long-awaited panaceas for the medical and pharmaceutical industries. Advanced 3D cell-printing technology and various functional bioinks are promising technologies in the field of tissue engineering that have enabled the fabrication of complex 3D living tissue/organs. Various requirements for these tissues, including a complex and large-volume structure, tissue-specific microenvironments, and functional vasculatures, have been addressed to develop engineered tissue/organs with native relevance. Functional tissue/organ constructs have been developed that satisfy such criteria and may facilitate both in vivo replenishment of damaged tissue and the development of reliable in vitro testing platforms for drug development.

33088998	Although three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting techniques enable the construction of various living tissues and organs, the generation of bone-like oriented microstructures with anisotropic texture remains a challenge. Inside the mineralized bone matrix, osteocytes play mechanosensing roles in an ordered manner with a well-developed lacunar-canaliculi system. Therefore, control of cellular arrangement and dendritic processes is indispensable for construction of artificially controlled 3D bone-mimetic architecture. Herein, we propose an innovative methodology to induce controlled arrangement of osteocyte dendritic processes using the laminated layer method of oriented collagen sheets, combined with a custom-made fluid flow stimuli system. Osteocyte dendritic processes showed elongation depending on the competitive directional relationship between flow and substrate. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to report the successful construction of the anisotropic bone-mimetic microstructure and further demonstrate that the dendritic process formation in osteocytes can be controlled with selective fluid flow stimuli, specifically by regulating focal adhesion. Our results demonstrate how osteocytes adapt to mechanical stimuli by optimizing the anisotropic maturation of dendritic cell processes.	3D Printing of Anisotropic Bone-Mimetic Structure with Controlled Fluid Flow Stimuli for Osteocytes: Flow Orientation Determines the Elongation of Dendrites.	2020		Matsugaki Aira;Matsuzaka Tadaaki;Murakami Ami;Wang Pan;Nakano Takayoshi	3D arrangement of bone matrix;Bioprinting;Collagen substrate;Mineralization;Osteocyte		International journal of bioprinting	Division of Materials and Manufacturing Science, Graduate School of Engineering, Osaka University, 2-1 Yamada-oka, Suita, Osaka 565-0871, Japan.;Division of Materials and Manufacturing Science, Graduate School of Engineering, Osaka University, 2-1 Yamada-oka, Suita, Osaka 565-0871, Japan.;Division of Materials and Manufacturing Science, Graduate School of Engineering, Osaka University, 2-1 Yamada-oka, Suita, Osaka 565-0871, Japan.;Singapore Institute of Manufacturing Technology, 73 Nanyang Drive, 637662, Singapore.;Division of Materials and Manufacturing Science, Graduate School of Engineering, Osaka University, 2-1 Yamada-oka, Suita, Osaka 565-0871, Japan.

33076526	Bioink based 3D bioprinting is a promising new technology that enables fabrication of complex tissue structures with living cells. The printability of the bioink depends on the physical properties such as viscosity. However, the high viscosity bioink puts shear stress on the cells and low viscosity bioink cannot maintain complex tissue structure firmly after the printing. In this work, we applied dual crosslinkable bioink using Kappa-carrageenan (κ-CA) to overcome existing shortcomings. κ-CA has properties such as biocompatibility, biodegradability, shear-thinning and ionic gelation but the difficulty of controlling gelation properties makes it unsuitable for application in 3D bioprinting. This problem was solved by synthesizing methacrylated Kappa-carrageenan (MA-κ-CA), which can be dual crosslinked through ionic and UV (Ultraviolet) crosslinking to form hydrogel using NIH-3T3 cells. Through MA substitutions, the rheological properties of the gel could be controlled to reduce the shear stress. Moreover, bioprinting using the cell-laden MA-κ-CA showed cell compatibility with enhanced shape retention capability. The potential to control the physical properties through dual crosslinking of MA-κ-CA hydrogel is expected to be widely applied in 3D bioprinting applications.

33072855	Next generation engineered tissue constructs with complex and ordered architectures aim to better mimic the native tissue structures, largely due to advances in three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting techniques. Extrusion bioprinting has drawn tremendous attention due to its widespread availability, cost-effectiveness, simplicity, and its facile and rapid processing. However, poor printing resolution and low speed have limited its fidelity and clinical implementation. To circumvent the downsides associated with extrusion printing, microfluidic technologies are increasingly being implemented in 3D bioprinting for engineering living constructs. These technologies enable biofabrication of heterogeneous biomimetic structures made of different types of cells, biomaterials, and biomolecules. Microfluiding bioprinting technology enables highly controlled fabrication of 3D constructs in high resolutions and it has been shown to be useful for building tubular structures and vascularized constructs, which may promote the survival and integration of implanted engineered tissues. Although this field is currently in its early development and the number of bioprinted implants is limited, it is envisioned that it will have a major impact on the production of customized clinical-grade tissue constructs. Further studies are, however, needed to fully demonstrate the effectiveness of the technology in the lab and its translation to the clinic.

33049961	From electronic devices to large-area electronics, from individual cells to skin substitutes, printing techniques are providing compelling applications in wide-ranging fields. Research has thus fueled the vision of a hybrid, printing platform to fabricate sensors/electronics and living engineered tissues simultaneously. Following this interest, we have fabricated interdigitated-electrode sensors (IDEs) by inkjet printing to monitor epithelial cell cultures. We have fabricated IDEs using flexible substrates with silver nanoparticles as a conductive element and SU-8 as the passivation layer. Our sensors are cytocompatible, have a topography that simulates microgrooves of 300 µm width and ~4 µm depth, and can be reused for cellular studies without detrimental in the electrical performance. To test the inkjet-printed sensors and demonstrate their potential use for monitoring laboratory-growth skin tissues, we have developed a real-time system and monitored label-free proliferation, migration, and detachment of keratinocytes by impedance spectroscopy. We have found that variations in the impedance correlate linearly to cell densities initially seeded and that the main component influencing the total impedance is the isolated effect of the cell membranes. Results obtained show that impedance can track cellular migration over the surface of the sensors, exhibiting a linear relationship with the standard method of image processing. Our results provide a useful approach for non-destructive in-situ monitoring of processes related to both in vitro epidermal models and wound healing with low-cost ink-jetted sensors. This type of flexible sensor as well as the impedance method are promising for the envisioned hybrid technology of 3D-bioprinted smart skin substitutes with built-in electronics.

33019639	Three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting is an additive manufacturing process that utilizes various biomaterials that either contain or interact with living cells and biological systems with the goal of fabricating functional tissue or organ mimics, which will be referred to as bioinks. These bioinks are typically hydrogel-based hybrid systems with many specific features and requirements. The characterizing and fine tuning of bioink properties before, during, and after printing are therefore essential in developing reproducible and stable bioprinted constructs. To date, myriad computational methods, mechanical testing, and rheological evaluations have been used to predict, measure, and optimize bioinks properties and their printability, but none are properly standardized. There is a lack of robust universal guidelines in the field for the evaluation and quantification of bioprintability. In this review, we introduced the concept of bioprintability and discussed the significant roles of various physiomechanical and biological processes in bioprinting fidelity. Furthermore, different quantitative and qualitative methodologies used to assess bioprintability will be reviewed, with a focus on the processes related to pre, during, and post printing. Establishing fully characterized, functional bioink solutions would be a big step towards the effective clinical applications of bioprinted products.

32995675	The incorporation of hydroxyapatite (HAP) into poly-l-lactic acid (PLLA) matrix serving as bone scaffold is expected to exhibit bioactivity and osteoconductivity to those of the living bone. While too low degradation rate of HAP/PLLA scaffold hinders the activity because the embedded HAP in the PLLA matrix is difficult to contact and exchange ions with body fluid. In this study, biodegradable polymer poly (glycolic acid) (PGA) was blended into the HAP/PLLA scaffold fabricated by laser 3D printing to accelerate the degradation. The results indicated that the incorporation of PGA enhanced the degradation rate of scaffold as indicated by the weight loss increasing from 3.3% to 25.0% after immersion for 28 days, owing to the degradation of high hydrophilic PGA and the subsequent accelerated hydrolysis of PLLA chains. Moreover, a lot of pores produced by the degradation of the scaffold promoted the exposure of HAP from the matrix, which not only activated the deposition of bone like apatite on scaffold but also accelerated apatite growth. Cytocompatibility tests exhibited a good osteoblast adhesion, spreading and proliferation, suggesting the scaffold provided a suitable environment for cell cultivation. Furthermore, the scaffold displayed excellent bone defect repair capacity with the formation of abundant new bone tissue and blood vessel tissue, and both ends of defect region were bridged after 8 weeks of implantation.

32994018	A critical-sized calvarial defect in rats is employed to reveal the osteoinductive properties of biomaterials. In this study, we investigate the osteogenic efficiency of hybrid scaffolds based on composites of a biodegradable and biocompatible polymer, poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) with hydroxyapatite (HA) filled with alginate (ALG) hydrogel containing mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) on the regeneration of the critical-sized radial defect of the parietal bone in rats. The scaffolds based on PHB and PHB/HA with desired shapes were prepared by two-stage salt leaching technique using a mold obtained by three-dimensional printing. To obtain PHB/HA/ALG/MSC scaffolds seeded with MSCs, the scaffolds were filled with ALG hydrogel containing MSCs; acellular PHB/ALG and PHB/ALG filled with empty ALG hydrogel were prepared for comparison. The produced scaffolds have high porosity and irregular interconnected pore structure. PHB/HA scaffolds supported MSC growth and induced cell osteogenic differentiation in a regular medium in vitro that was manifested by an increase in ALP activity and expression of the CD45 phenotype marker. The data of computed tomography and histological studies showed 94% and 92%, respectively, regeneration of critical-sized calvarial bone defect in vivo at 28th day after implantation of MSC-seeded PHB/HA/ALG/MSC scaffolds with 3.6 times higher formation of the main amount of bone tissue at 22-28 days in comparison with acellular PHB/HA/ALG scaffolds that was shown at the first time by fluorescent microscopy using the original technique of intraperitoneal administration of fluorescent dyes to living postoperative rats. The obtained in vivo results can be associated with the MSC-friendly microstructure and in vitro osteogenic properties of PHB/HA base-scaffolds. Thus, the obtained data demonstrate the potential of MSCs encapsulated in the bioactive biopolymer/mineral/hydrogel scaffold to improve the bone regeneration process in critical-sized bone defects.

32984274	We successfully fabricated artificial bile duct via 3D printing technique which was composed of poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) and gelatin methacrylate (GelMA). The PLGA-inner layer provided sufficient strength to support the bile duct contraction, the GelMA-outer layer possessed good biocompatibility to provide a good living environment for the cells. Moreover, IKVAV laminin peptide (Ile-Lys-Val-Ala-Val) and ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide (USPIO) were used to regulate scaffold cell adhesion and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) detection, respectively. After BMSCs co-culture with IKVAV at a certain concentration, the survival rate and adhesion of BMSCs was increased obviously. Meanwhile, the fabricated scaffold exhibited the tensile modulus in the range of 17.19 - 29.05 MPa and the compressive modulus in the range of 0.042 - 0.066 MPa, which could meet the needs of human implantation. In an animal experiment in vivo pig bile duct regeneration, PLGA/GelMA/IKVAV/USPIO duct conduits could promote bile duct regeneration and enhance cytokeratin 19 (CK19) expression. In summary, the composite bile duct scaffold with excellent MRI imaging function and biocompatibility could be used to develop bioactive artificial bile ducts.

32977633	Reconstruction of bony defects is challenging when conventional grafting methods are used because of their intrinsic limitations (biological cost and/or biological properties). Bone regeneration techniques are rapidly evolving since the introduction of three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting. Bone tissue engineering is a branch of regenerative medicine that aims to find new solutions to treat bone defects, which can be repaired by 3D printed living tissues. Its aim is to overcome the limitations of conventional treatment options by improving osteoinduction and osteoconduction. Several techniques of bone bioprinting have been developed: inkjet, extrusion, and light-based 3D printers are nowadays available. Bioinks, i.e., the printing materials, also presented an evolution over the years. It seems that these new technologies might be extremely promising for bone regeneration. The purpose of the present review is to give a comprehensive summary of the past, the present, and future developments of bone bioprinting and bioinks, focusing the attention on crucial aspects of bone bioprinting such as selecting cell sources and attaining a viable vascularization within the newly printed bone. The main bioprinters currently available on the market and their characteristics have been taken into consideration, as well.

32911867	Three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting is an appealing and revolutionary manufacturing approach for the accurate placement of biologics, such as living cells and extracellular matrix (ECM) components, in the form of a 3D hierarchical structure to fabricate synthetic multicellular tissues. Many synthetic and natural polymers are applied as cell printing bioinks. One of them, alginate (Alg), is an inexpensive biomaterial that is among the most examined hydrogel materials intended for vascular, cartilage, and bone tissue printing. It has also been studied pertaining to the liver, kidney, and skin, due to its excellent cell response and flexible gelation preparation through divalent ions including calcium. Nevertheless, Alg hydrogels possess certain negative aspects, including weak mechanical characteristics, poor printability, poor structural stability, and poor cell attachment, which may restrict its usage along with the 3D printing approach to prepare artificial tissue. In this review paper, we prepare the accessible materials to be able to encourage and boost new Alg-based bioink formulations with superior characteristics for upcoming purposes in drug delivery systems. Moreover, the major outcomes are discussed, and the outstanding concerns regarding this area and the scope for upcoming examination are outlined.

32911103	"Common events in the clinic, such as uterine curettage or inflammation, may lead to irreversible endometrial damage, often resulting in infertility in women of childbearing age. Currently, tissue engineering has the potential to achieve tissue manipulation, regeneration, and growth, but personalization and precision remain challenges. The application of ""3D cell printing"" is more in line with the clinical requirements of tissue repair. In this study, a porous grid-type human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived mesenchymal stem cell (hiMSC)-loaded hydrogel scaffold was constructed using a 3D bioprinting device. The 3D-printed hydrogel scaffold provided a permissive in vitro living environment for hiMSCs and significantly increased the survival duration of transplanted hiMSCs when compared with hiMSCs administered locally in vivo. Using an endometrial injury model, we found that hiMSC transplantation can cause early host immune responses (the serological immune response continued for more than 1 month, and the local immune response continued for approximately 1 week). Compared with the sham group, although the regenerative endometrium failed to show full restoration of the normal structure and function of the lining, implantation of the 3D-printed hiMSC-loaded scaffold not only promoted the recovery of the endometrial histomorphology (endometrial tissue and gland regeneration) and the regeneration of endometrial cells (stromal cells and epithelial cells) and endothelial cells but also improved endometrial receptivity functional indicators, namely, pinopode formation and leukemia inhibitory factor and αvβ3 expression, which partly restored the embryo implantation and pregnancy maintenance functions of the injured endometrium. These indicators were significantly better in the 3D-printed hiMSC-loaded scaffold group than in the unrepaired (empty) group, the hiMSCs alone group and the 3D scaffold group, and the empty group showed the worst repair results. Our study confirm that the 3D-printed hiMSC-loaded hydrogel scaffold may be a promising material for endometrial repair."	3D Bioprinting a human iPSC-derived MSC-loaded scaffold for repair of the uterine endometrium.	2020	Oct	Ji Wanqing;Hou Bo;Lin Weige;Wang Linli;Zheng Wenhan;Li Weidong;Zheng Jie;Wen Xuejun;He Ping	3D bioprinting;Curettage;Endometrial receptivity;Endometrium;Human iPSC-derived mesenchymal stem cell;Hydrogel scaffold;Regeneration	Bioprinting;Endometrium;Endothelial Cells;Female;Humans;Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells;Mesenchymal Stem Cells;Pregnancy	Acta biomaterialia	Department of Obstetrics, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, 510623, China.;Departments of Neurosurgery, The Third Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, 510630, China.;Department of Obstetrics, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, 510623, China.;Guangzhou Regenerative Medicine Research Center, Future Homo sapiens Research Institute Co., Ltd., China.;Departments of Neurosurgery, The Third Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, 510630, China.;Department of Maternal and Child Health Information, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China.;Department of Obstetrics, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, 510623, China.;Department of Chemical and Life Science Engineering, Virginia Commonwealth University, 601 West Main Street, Richmond, VA 23220, USA.

32907514	Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disorder in which the body's own immune system selectively attacks beta cells within pancreatic islets resulting in insufficient insulin production and loss of the ability to regulate blood glucose (BG) levels. Currently, the standard of care consists of BG level monitoring and insulin administration, which are essential to avoid the consequences of dysglycemia and long-term complications. Although recent advances in continuous glucose monitoring and automated insulin delivery systems have resulted in improved clinical outcomes for users, nearly 80% of people with T1D fail to achieve their target hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels defined by the American Diabetes Association. Intraportal islet transplantation into immunosuppressed individuals with T1D suffering from impaired awareness of hypoglycemia has resulted in lower HbA1c, elimination of severe hypoglycemic events, and insulin independence, demonstrating the unique potential of beta cell replacement therapy (BCRT) in providing optimal glycemic control and a functional cure for T1D. BCRTs need to maximize cell engraftment, long-term survival, and function in the absence of immunosuppression to provide meaningful clinical outcomes to all people living with T1D. One innovative technology that could enable widespread translation of this approach into the clinic is three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting. Herein, we review how bioprinting could facilitate translation of BCRTs as well as the current and forthcoming techniques used for bioprinting of a BCRT product. We discuss the strengths and weaknesses of 3D bioprinting in this context in addition to the road ahead for the development of BCRTs. Impact statement Significant research developments in beta cell replacement therapies show its promise in providing a functional cure for type 1 diabetes (T1D); yet, their widespread clinical use has been difficult to achieve. This review provides a brief overview of the requirements for a beta cell replacement product followed by a discussion on both the promise and limitations of three-dimensional bioprinting in facilitating the fabrication of such products to enable translation into the clinic. Advancements in this area could be a key component to unlocking the safety and effectiveness of beta cell therapy for T1D.	3D Bioprinting and Translation of Beta Cell Replacement Therapies for Type 1 Diabetes.	2021	Jun	Gurlin Rachel E;Giraldo Jaime A;Latres Esther	3D printing;beta cell replacement therapy;bioprinting;type 1 diabetes	Bioprinting;Blood Glucose;Blood Glucose Self-Monitoring;Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1;Humans;Islets of Langerhans Transplantation	Tissue engineering.

32902201	The field of 3D printing is an area of active research, with a substantial focus given to the design and construction of customized tools for applications in technology. There exists a particular need in these developing areas of opportunity for new multi-functional soft materials that are biologically compatible for the growth and directed culturing of cells. Herein, a composite material consisting of gold nanoparticles with useful plasmonic properties embedded within a highly hydrophilic poly-2-hydroxyethylmethacrylate matrix is described and characterized. This composite material serves dual functions as both host framework scaffold for cell lines such as pre-osteoblasts as well as a plasmonic biosensor for in situ measurements of living cells. The plasmonic properties of this system are characterized as a function of the material properties and related to compositional features of the material through a proposed light-directed mechanism. This chemistry provides a tunable, 3D printable plasmonic composite material of encapsulated gold nanoparticles in a biologically-compliant, acrylate-based hydrogel matrix.

32901632	The use of organic photo-redox catalysts to initiate well-controlled photochemical reactions has aroused great interest. The development of visible light-driven photocatalytic reactions, which enable rapid and efficient synthesis of fine products, is highly desired from the perspective of being able to achieve low cost, good reversibility, and environmental friendliness. Herein, the organic photocatalytic cycle, with organic dithienophosphole (DTP) derivatives Ph-DTP and TPA-DTP as the photo-redox catalysts, and iodonium salt (Ar2I+) and ethyl 4-(dimethylamino)benzoate (EDB) as the respective acceptor and donor substrates, is fully analyzed by using density functional theory and dissociative electron transfer theory. We show that the strong redox potentials in the excited state as well as the sufficiently long-lived excited state of both DTP derivatives are a robust driving force for activating the electron acceptor Ar2I+ in the activation process. Moreover, the activation barriers of electron transfer are only 0.43-11.9 kcal mol-1 for the different activation pathways. During the deactivation process, the reaction energy profiles indicate that EDB plays a vital role in reducing DTPs˙+ to their initial states. Importantly, the activation barriers and rate constants in both activation and deactivation processes obtained in this study are better than those of classic Cu-based and metal-free Ph-PTZ-based photo-redox catalysts. The excellent performance of both DTP derivatives thus enables them to be highly efficient organic photo-redox catalysts.

32878273	Hydrogel-based bio-inks have recently attracted more attention for 3D printing applications in tissue engineering due to their remarkable intrinsic properties, such as a cell supporting environment. However, their usually weak mechanical properties lead to poor printability and low stability of the obtained structures. To obtain good shape fidelity, current approaches based on extrusion printing use high viscosity solutions, which can compromise cell viability. This paper presents a novel bio-printing methodology based on a dual-syringe system with a static mixing tool that allows in situ crosslinking of a two-component hydrogel-based ink in the presence of living cells. The reactive hydrogel system consists of carboxymethyl chitosan (CMCh) and partially oxidized hyaluronic acid (HAox) that undergo fast self-covalent crosslinking via Schiff base formation. This new approach allows us to use low viscosity solutions since in situ gelation provides the appropriate structural integrity to maintain the printed shape. The proposed bio-ink formulation was optimized to match crosslinking kinetics with the printing process and multi-layered 3D bio-printed scaffolds were successfully obtained. Printed scaffolds showed moderate swelling, good biocompatibility with embedded cells, and were mechanically stable after 14 days of the cell culture. We envision that this straightforward, powerful, and generalizable printing approach can be used for a wide range of materials, growth factors, or cell types, to be employed for soft tissue regeneration.	3D Printing of a Reactive Hydrogel Bio-Ink Using a Static Mixing Tool.	2020	Aug	Puertas-Bartolomé María;Włodarczyk-Biegun Małgorzata K;Del Campo Aránzazu;Vázquez-Lasa Blanca;San Román Julio	3D-bioprinting;chitosan;hyaluronic acid;reactive hydrogel;static mixer		Polymers	Institute of Polymer Science and Technology, ICTP-CSIC, Juan de la Cierva 3, 28006 Madrid, Spain.;CIBER's Bioengineering, Biomaterials and Nanomedicine, CIBER-BBN, Health Institute Carlos III, Monforte de Lemos 3-5, 28029 Madrid, Spain.;INM-Leibniz Institute for New Materials, Campus D2 2, 66123 Saarbrücken, Germany.;INM-Leibniz Institute for New Materials, Campus D2 2, 66123 Saarbrücken, Germany.;Chemistry Department, Saarland University, 66123 Saarbrücken, Germany.;Institute of Polymer Science and Technology, ICTP-CSIC, Juan de la Cierva 3, 28006 Madrid, Spain.;CIBER's Bioengineering, Biomaterials and Nanomedicine, CIBER-BBN, Health Institute Carlos III, Monforte de Lemos 3-5, 28029 Madrid, Spain.;Institute of Polymer Science and Technology, ICTP-CSIC, Juan de la Cierva 3, 28006 Madrid, Spain.;CIBER's Bioengineering, Biomaterials and Nanomedicine, CIBER-BBN, Health Institute Carlos III, Monforte de Lemos 3-5, 28029 Madrid, Spain.

32869529	As a milestone in soft and hard tissue engineering, a precise control over the micropatterns of scaffolds has lightened new opportunities for the recapitulation of native body organs through three dimentional (3D) bioprinting approaches. Well-printable bioinks are prerequisites for the bioprinting of tissues/organs where hydrogels play a critical role. Despite the outstanding developments in 3D engineered microstructures, current printer devices suffer from the risk of exposing loaded living agents to mechanical (nozzle-based) and thermal (nozzle-free) stresses. Thus, tuning the rheological, physical, and mechanical properties of hydrogels is a promising solution to address these issues. The relationship between the mechanical characteristics of hydrogels and their printability is important to control printing quality and fidelity. Recent developments in defining this relationship have highlighted the decisive role of main additive manufacturing strategies. These strategies are applied to enhance the printing quality of scaffolds and determine the nurture of cellular morphology. In this regard, it is beneficial to use external and internal stabilization, photocurable biopolymers, and cooling substrates containing the printed scaffolds. The objective of this study is to review cutting-edge developments in hydrogel-type bioinks and discuss the optimum simulation of the zonal stratification in osteochondral and cartilage units.

32864483	As the demand for organ transplants continues to grow faster than the supply of available donor organs, a new source of functional organs is needed. High resolution high throughput 3D bioprinting is one approach towards generating functional organs for transplantation. For high throughput printing, the need for increased print resolutions (by decreasing printing nozzle diameter) has a consequence: it increases the forces that cause cell damage during the printing process. Here, a novel cell encapsulation method provides mechanical protection from complete lysis of individual living cells during extrusion-based bioprinting. Cells coated in polymers possessing the mechanical properties finely-tuned to maintain size and shape following extrusion, and these encapsulated cells are protected from mechanical lysis. However, the shear forces imposed on the cells during extrusion still cause sufficient damage to compromise the cell membrane integrity and adversely impact normal cellular function. Cellular damage occurred during the extrusion process independent of the rapid depressurization.

32856892	Three-dimensional bioprinting uses additive manufacturing techniques for the automated fabrication of hierarchically organized living constructs. The building blocks are often hydrogel-based bioinks, which need to be printed into structures with high shape fidelity to the intended computer-aided design. For optimal cell performance, relatively soft and printable inks are preferred, although these undergo significant deformation during the printing process, which may impair shape fidelity. While the concept of good or poor printability seems rather intuitive, its quantitative definition lacks consensus and depends on multiple rheological and chemical parameters of the ink. This review discusses qualitative and quantitative methodologies to evaluate printability of bioinks for extrusion- and lithography-based bioprinting. The physicochemical parameters influencing shape fidelity are discussed, together with their importance in establishing new models, predictive tools and printing methods that are deemed instrumental for the design of next-generation bioinks, and for reproducible comparison of their structural performance.

32847683	It is still a challenge for existing bioprinting technologies to fabricate organs suitable for implantation, mainly due to the inability to recapitulate the organs' complex anatomical structures, mechanical properties, and biological functions. Additionally, the failure to create 3D constructs with interconnected microchannels for long-range mass transportation that limits the clinical applications of 3D printing technologies. Here, a new method was developed to print functional living skin (FLS) using a newly designed biomimetic bioink (GelMA/HA-NB/LAP) and digital light processing (DLP)-based 3D printing technology. The FLS possess interconnected microchannels that facilitates cell migration, proliferation and neo-tissue formation. The GelMA/HA-NB/LAP bioink, composed of gelatin methacrylate (GelMA), N-(2-aminoethyl)-4-(4-(hydroxymethyl)-2-methoxy-5-nitrosophenoxy) butanamide (NB) linked hyaluronic acid (HA-NB) and photo-initiator lithium phenyl-2,4,6-trimethylbenzoylphosphinate (LAP). The bioink demonstrated its rapid gelation kinetics, tunable mechanical properties, good biocompatibility and tissue adhesion. The DLP-based 3D printing technology provides a rapid method to precisely position clusters of human skin fibroblasts (HSFs) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) with high cell viability to form FLS. The FLS promotes skin regeneration and efficient neovascularization by mimicking the physiological structure of natural skin, and it can also be easily handled and implanted onto the wound site due to its strong mechanical and bio-adhesive properties. Moreover, in vivo study demonstrated that the living skin exhibited instant defense function and had superior performance in promoting dermal regeneration with skin appendages in large animals. This study provides a rapid and mass production method of functional living organs for future clinical applications.

32834232	Indeed, the scientific milestones set by the ever-emerging three-dimensional printing (3DP) technologies are tremendous. Till now, the innovative 3DP technologies have benefitted the aerospace, automobile, textile, pharmaceutical, and biomedical sectors by developing pre-requisite designed and customized performance standards of the end-user products. As the scientific world, at this moment, is expediting efforts to fight against the highly damaging novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, the 3DP technologies are facilitating creative solutions in terms of personal protective equipment (PPE), medical equipment (such as ventilators and other respiratory devices), and other health and welfare tools to aid the personal hygiene as well as safe environment for humans by restricting the communication of risks. Various sources (including journal articles, news articles, white papers of the government and other non-profit organizations, commercial enterprises, as well as academic institutions have been reviewed for the collection of the information relevant to COVID-19 and 3DP. This communication presents the recent applications of the 3DP technologies aiding in developing innovative products designed to save the lives of millions of people around the world. Moreover, the potential of 3DP technologies in developing test swabs and controlled medicines has been highlighted. The literature reviewed in the present study indicated that the fused filament fabrication (FFF) is one of the most preferred technologies and contribute about 62% in the overall production of the protective gears developed through overall class of 3DP.

32832880	Living tissues dynamically modulate their structure and functions through physical and biochemical interactions in the three-dimensional (3D)-microenvironment for their homeostasis or the developmental process of an embryo. However, the manipulation of cellular functions in vitro is still challenging due to the lack of a dynamic material system that can vary the 3D-cellular microenvironment in time and space. Here, we show an in situ 3D-printing technique based on multiphoton lithography using a biocompatible photoresist, bio-ink. The bio-ink composed of protein-photosensitizer conjugates has the ability to cause singlet oxygen and cross-linking reaction to fabricate protein gels with submicrometer-scale precision. Remarkably, the conjugates substantially improve the cytocompatibility and the efficiency of gelation due to the stealth effect of rose bengal (RB) and efficient transfer of singlet oxygen to bovine serum albumin (BSA). 3D-printing in the presence of cells allows for the microfabrication of a protein scaffold and controlled single-cell behavior. This dynamic material system to direct cell fate may offer emerging applications for drug discovery and regenerative medicine.

32815365	Natural organisms provide inspirations for various functional structures and surfaces with significant applications in multidisciplinary fields. These biological systems are generally composed of multiscale surface structures with high geometric complexity and a variety of materials, making it challenging to replicate their characteristics in engineering. This study presents a novel multiscale multimaterial 3D printing method, magnetic field-assisted stereolithography (M-SL), for fabricating hierarchical particle-polymer structures with surface features ranging from a few nanometers to millimeters or even centimeters. Taking inspiration from nature, this study describes the design and fabrication of a bioinspired multiscale hierarchical surface structure, which is characterized of microscale cones, nanoscale pores, and surface wrinkles at a few nanometers. To understand the fundamental physics underlying the hierarchical surface structure fabrication in the proposed M-SL process, the complexities among the M-SL process parameters, material parameters, and printed geometries are discussed. The accuracy of the developed printing method is investigated by comparing the printed geometries and digital designs. Effects of the printed hierarchical surface structure on hydrophobicity and cell viability were characterized and discussed. It was found that the highly hierarchical surface structure changed the polymer composite surface from hydrophilic (contact angle: ∼38°) to hydrophobic (∼146°). In addition, the hierarchical surface structure also created a better environment for cell attachment and growth, with 900% more living cells at 72 h after cell seeding, compared with cells on the nonstructured smooth surface. Local and selective cell seeding can also be enabled by the surface structure design. Experimental results validated the effectiveness of the M-SL 3D printing method on fabricating multimaterial functional objects with hierarchically structured surfaces for a wide spectrum of applications.

32813733	To function effectively, a lower limb prosthetic socket must remain securely coupled to the residual limb during walking, running and other activities of daily living; this coupling is referred to as suspension. When this coupling is insufficient longitudinal pistoning of the socket relative to the residual limb occurs. Increasing friction of the socket/liner interface may improve socket suspension and textured sockets may be fabricated relatively easily with 3D printing. The aim of this study was to investigate longitudinal displacement of sockets with different types of textures under two suspension conditions: passive suction and active vacuum. In order to do this, we developed a mock residual limb and mechanical testing protocol. Prosthetic sockets, 14 textured sockets and an Original Squirt-Shape (OSS) Socket, were fabricated from polypropylene copolymer using the Squirt-Shape™ 3D Printer and compared to a smooth socket thermoformed from polypropylene copolymer. Sockets were mounted onto a dual durometer mock residual limb and subjected to four levels of distraction forces (100 N, 250 N, 500 N and 650 N) using a hydraulic material testing system. There was a statistically significant three-way interaction between suspension, force level and texture (p < 0.0005). Longitudinal displacements between textured and reference sockets, for all force levels and both suspension conditions, were significantly different (p < 0.0005). Using these newly developed mechanical testing protocols, it was demonstrated that texturing of polypropylene copolymer sockets fabricated using Squirt-Shape significantly decreased longitudinal displacements compared to a smooth socket.

32806758	The peripheral nervous system controls the functions of sensation, movement and motor coordination of the body. Peripheral nerves can get damaged easily by trauma or neurodegenerative diseases. The injury can cause a devastating effect on the affected individual and his aides. Treatment modalities include anti-inflammatory medications, physiotherapy, surgery, nerve grafting and rehabilitation. 3D bioprinted peripheral nerve conduits serve as nerve grafts to fill the gaps of severed nerve bodies. The application of induced pluripotent stem cells, its derivatives and bioprinting are important techniques that come in handy while making living peripheral nerve conduits. The design of nerve conduits and bioprinting require comprehensive information on neural architecture, type of injury, neural supporting cells, scaffold materials to use, neural growth factors to add and to streamline the mechanical properties of the conduit. This paper gives a perspective on the factors to consider while bioprinting the peripheral nerve conduits.

32805500	Recent advances in 3D bioprinting have transformed the tissue engineering landscape by enabling the controlled placement of cells, biomaterials, and bioactive agents for the biofabrication of living tissues and organs. However, the application of 3D bioprinting is limited by the availability of cytocompatible and printable biomaterials that recapitulate properties of native tissues. Here, we developed an integrated 3D projection bioprinting and orthogonal photoconjugation platform for precision tissue engineering of tailored microenvironments. By using a photoreactive thiol-ene gelatin bioink, soft hydrogels can be bioprinted into complex geometries and photopatterned with bioactive moieties in a rapid and scalable manner via digital light projection (DLP) technology. This enables localized modulation of biophysical properties such as stiffness and microarchitecture as well as precise control over spatial distribution and concentration of immobilized functional groups. As such, well-defined properties can be directly incorporated using a single platform to produce desired tissue-specific functions within bioprinted constructs. We demonstrated high viability of encapsulated endothelial cells and human cardiomyocytes using our dual process and fabricated tissue constructs functionalized with VEGF peptide mimics to induce guided endothelial cell growth for programmable vascularization. This work represents a pivotal step in engineering multifunctional constructs with unprecedented control, precision, and versatility for the rational design of biomimetic tissues.

32786925	Microbes that form biofilms on electrodes and generate electrical current responses could be integrated into devices to perform sensing, conduct signals, or act as living microprocessors. A challenge in working with these species is the ability to visualize biofilm formation and protein expression in real-time while also measuring current, which is not possible with typical bio-electrochemical reactors. Here, we present a three-dimensional-printed flow cell for simultaneous electrochemistry and fluorescence imaging. Current-producing biofilms of Marinobacter atlanticus constitutively expressing green fluorescent protein were grown on the flow cell working electrode. Increasing current corresponded with increasing surface coverage and was comparable to biofilms grown in typical stirred-batch reactors. An isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) inducible system driving yellow fluorescent protein was used to assess the spatiotemporal activation of protein expression within the biofilm at different stages of growth and induction dynamics. The response time ranged from 30 min to 5 h, depending on the conditions. These data demonstrate that the electrochemical flow cell can evaluate the performance of an electrically active environmental bacterium under conditions relevant for development as a living electronic sensor.

32784960	Three-dimensional bioprinting has rapidly paralleled many biomedical applications and assisted in advancing the printing of complex human organs for a better therapeutic practice. The objective of this systematic review is to highlight evidence from the existing studies and evaluate the effectiveness of using natural-based bioinks in skin regeneration and wound healing. A comprehensive search of all relevant original articles was performed based on prespecified eligibility criteria. The search was carried out using PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Medline Ovid, and ScienceDirect. Eighteen articles fulfilled the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The animal studies included a total of 151 animals with wound defects. A variety of natural bioinks and skin living cells were implanted in vitro to give insight into the technique through different assessments and findings. Collagen and gelatin hydrogels were most commonly used as bioinks. The follow-up period ranged between one day and six weeks. The majority of animal studies reported that full wound closure was achieved after 2-4 weeks. The results of both in vitro cell culture and in vivo animal studies showed the positive impact of natural bioinks in promoting wound healing. Future research should be focused more on direct the bioprinting of skin wound treatments on animal models to open doors for human clinical trials.

32782987	Recently, three-dimensional (3D) printing technologies have been widely applied in industry and our daily lives. The term 3D bioprinting has been coined to describe 3D printing at the biomedical level. Machine learning is currently becoming increasingly active and has been used to improve 3D printing processes, such as process optimization, dimensional accuracy analysis, manufacturing defect detection, and material property prediction. However, few studies have been found to use machine learning in 3D bioprinting processes. In this paper, related machine learning methods used in 3D printing are briefly reviewed and a perspective on how machine learning can also benefit 3D bioprinting is discussed. We believe that machine learning can significantly affect the future development of 3D bioprinting and hope this paper can inspire some ideas on how machine learning can be used to improve 3D bioprinting.

32776707	Construction of organized three-dimensional (3D) tissue with extracellular matrix (ECM) and multiple types of cells is important for tissue engineering to enable tissue function and enhance cellular function. However, the concentration of ECM and the thickness of the 3D tissue have been limited in previous methods due to a lack of permeability to nutrients and oxygen. Besides, it is difficult to use matured natural ECM as a cell scaffold without chemical modification due to its insolubility. In this article, we focus on multi-layered structure, which is commonly found in living tissue such as skin, blood vessels, and other organs. Here, we describe the preparation of a paper-like scaffold (ECM paper) from micro-fibered natural ECM and the construction of 3D multi-layered tissue composed of cell layers and ECM layers by stacking cell-seeded ECM papers. The thickness and components of the ECM layers are easily controllable by changing the composition of the ECM papers, and the fibrous structure of ECM paper shows high permeability and permits cell migration. Additionally, the ECM microfiber, which is physically defiberized from natural ECM, has a high ECM concentration equal to that of living tissue and high stability under physiological conditions. Therefore, this set of protocols enables construction of multi-layered 3D tissue composed of precisely controlled ECM layers and cell layers that may contribute to the assembly of tissue models. © 2020 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

32748107	Many techniques for engineering and interrogating three-dimensional (3-D) muscle bundles from animal- or patient-derived myoblasts have recently been developed to overcome the limitations of existing in vitro and in vivo model systems. However, many approaches for engineering 3-D muscle bundles rely on specialized and time-consuming techniques, such as photolithography for fabrication and cryosectioning for histology. Cryosectioning also limits visualization to a single plane instead of the entire 3-D structure. To address these challenges, we first implemented a consumer-grade 3-D-printer to rapidly prototype multiple templates for engineering muscle bundles. We then employed our templates to engineer 3D muscle bundles and identify template geometries that promoted bundle survival over three weeks. Subsequently, we implemented tissue clearing, immunostaining, and confocal imaging to acquire z-stacks of intact muscle bundles labelled for myogenic markers. With this approach, we could select the imaging plane on-demand and visualize the intact 3-D structure of bundles. However, tissue clearing did cause some tissue degradation that should be considered. Together, these advances in muscle tissue engineering and imaging will accelerate the use of these 3-D tissue platforms for disease modeling and therapeutic discovery.

32722540	"We present work in 3D printing electric motors from basic materials as the key to building a self-replicating machine to colonise the Moon. First, we explore the nature of the biological realm to ascertain its essence, particularly in relation to the origin of life when the inanimate became animate. We take an expansive view of this to ascertain parallels between the biological and the manufactured worlds. Life must have emerged from the available raw material on Earth and, similarly, a self-replicating machine must exploit and leverage the available resources on the Moon. We then examine these lessons to explore the construction of a self-replicating machine using a universal constructor. It is through the universal constructor that the actuator emerges as critical. We propose that 3D printing constitutes an analogue of the biological ribosome and that 3D printing may constitute a universal construction mechanism. Following a description of our progress in 3D printing motors, we suggest that this engineering effort can inform biology, that motors are a key facet of living organisms and illustrate the importance of motors in biology viewed from the perspective of engineering (in the Feynman spirit of ""what I cannot create, I cannot understand"")."

32715284	Additive manufacturing allows three-dimensional printing of polymeric materials together with cells, creating living materials for applications in biomedical research and biotechnology. However, an understanding of the cellular phenotype within living materials is lacking, which is a key limitation for their wider application. Herein, we present an approach to characterize the cellular phenotype within living materials. We immobilized the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae in three different photo-cross-linkable triblock polymeric hydrogels containing F127-bis-urethane methacrylate, F127-dimethacrylate, or poly(alkyl glycidyl ether)-dimethacrylate. Using optical and scanning electron microscopy, we showed that hydrogels based on these polymers were stable under physiological conditions, but yeast colonies showed differences in the interaction within the living materials. We found that the physical confinement, imparted by compositional and structural properties of the hydrogels, impacted the cellular phenotype by reducing the size of cells in living materials compared with suspension cells. These properties also contributed to the differences in immobilization patterns, growth of colonies, and colony coatings. We observed that a composition-dependent degradation of polymers was likely possible by cells residing in the living materials. In conclusion, our investigation highlights the need for a holistic understanding of the cellular response within hydrogels to facilitate the synthesis of application-specific polymers and the design of advanced living materials in the future.

32662642	Photoactivated materials have found widespread use in biological and medical applications and are playing an increasingly important role in the nascent field of three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting. Light can be used as a trigger to drive the formation or the degradation of chemical bonds, leading to unprecedented spatiotemporal control over a material's chemical, physical, and biological properties. With resolution and construct size ranging from nanometers to centimeters, light-mediated biofabrication allows multicellular and multimaterial approaches. It promises to be a powerful tool to mimic the complex multiscale organization of living tissues including skin, bone, cartilage, muscle, vessels, heart, and liver, among others, with increasing organotypic functionality. With this review, we comprehensively discuss photochemical reactions, photoactivated materials, and their use in state-of-the-art deposition-based (extrusion and droplet) and vat polymerization-based (one- and two-photon) bioprinting. By offering an up-to-date view on these techniques, we identify emerging trends, focusing on both the chemistry and instrument aspects, thereby allowing the readers to select the best-suited approach. Starting with photochemical reactions and photoactivated materials, we then discuss principles, applications, and limitations of each technique. With a critical eye to the most recent achievements, the reader is guided through this exciting, emerging field, with special emphasis on cell-laden hydrogel constructs.

32644779	3D bioprinting is one of the latest trends in regenerative medicine due to its capacity for constructing highly organized tissues with living cells. In this work, silk fibroin (SF) together with hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (HPMC) was used to print bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell (BMSC)-laden double network (DN) hydrogel for cartilage tissue repair. The β-sheet structure formed among SF molecules was set as the rigid and brittle first network, while the cross-linking of HPMC-MA was set as the soft and ductile second network. Compared to the single network hydrogel, the fracture strength, breaking elongation, and compressive reproducibility increased significantly. Thereafter, the evaluation of cell proliferation and biochemical assay of this BMSC-laden 3D bioprinted hydrogel proved that it could ensure sufficient nutrient supply and great biochemical supportability in tissue engineering. This SF-based bioink with remarkable mechanical properties holds great promise as candidate for cartilage tissue regeneration.	3D Bioprinting of Bone Marrow Mesenchymal Stem Cell-Laden Silk Fibroin Double Network Scaffolds for Cartilage Tissue Repair.	2020	Aug	Ni Tianyu;Liu Min;Zhang Yajie;Cao Yi;Pei Renjun		Bioprinting;Cartilage;Cell Proliferation;Fibroins;Gene Expression Regulation;Humans;Lactose;Mesenchymal Stem Cells;Methylcellulose;Microscopy, Electron, Scanning;Printing, Three-Dimensional;Regenerative Medicine;Tissue Engineering;Tissue Scaffolds	Bioconjugate chemistry	CAS Key Laboratory for Nano-Bio Interface, Suzhou Institute of Nano-Tech and Nano-Bionics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Suzhou 215123, P.

32638296	Three-dimensional (3D) visualization involves feature extraction and 3D reconstruction of CT images using a computer processing technology. It is a tool for displaying, describing, and interpreting 3D anatomy and morphological features of organs, thus providing intuitive, stereoscopic, and accurate methods for clinical decision-making. It has played an increasingly significant role in the diagnosis and management of liver diseases. Over the last decade, it has been proven safe and effective to use 3D simulation software for pre-hepatectomy assessment, virtual hepatectomy, and measurement of liver volumes in blood flow areas of the portal vein; meanwhile, the use of 3D models in combination with hydrodynamic analysis has become a novel non-invasive method for diagnosis and detection of portal hypertension. We herein describe the progress of research on 3D visualization, its workflow, current situation, challenges, opportunities, and its capacity to improve clinical decision-making, emphasizing its utility for patients with liver diseases. Current advances in modern imaging technologies have promised a further increase in diagnostic efficacy of liver diseases. For example, complex internal anatomy of the liver and detailed morphological features of liver lesions can be reflected from CT-based 3D models. A meta-analysis reported that the application of 3D visualization technology in the diagnosis and management of primary hepatocellular carcinoma has significant or extremely significant differences over the control group in terms of intraoperative blood loss, postoperative complications, recovery of postoperative liver function, operation time, hospitalization time, and tumor recurrence on short-term follow-up. However, the acquisition of high-quality CT images and the use of these images for 3D visualization processing lack a unified standard, quality control system, and homogeneity, which might hinder the evaluation of application efficacy in different clinical centers, causing enormous inconvenience to clinical practice and scientific research. Therefore, rigorous operating guidelines and quality control systems need to be established for 3D visualization of liver to develop it to become a mature technology. Herein, we provide recommendations for the research on diagnosis and management of 3D visualization in liver diseases to meet this urgent need in this research field.

32635214	In the last few years, the employment of 3D printing technologies in the manufacture of drug delivery systems has increased, due to the advantages that they offer for personalized medicine. Thus, the possibility of producing sophisticated and tailor-made structures loaded with drugs intended for tissue engineering and optimizing the drug dose is particularly interesting in the case of pediatric and geriatric population. Natural products provide a wide range of advantages for their application as pharmaceutical excipients, as well as in scaffolds purposed for tissue engineering prepared by 3D printing technologies. The ability of biopolymers to form hydrogels is exploited in pressure assisted microsyringe and inkjet techniques, resulting in suitable porous matrices for the printing of living cells, as well as thermolabile drugs. In this review, we analyze the 3D printing technologies employed for the preparation of drug delivery systems based on natural products. Moreover, the 3D printed drug delivery systems containing natural products are described, highlighting the advantages offered by these types of excipients.	3D Printed Drug Delivery Systems Based on Natural Products.	2020	Jul	Aguilar-De-Leyva Ángela;Linares Vicente;Casas Marta;Caraballo Isidoro	3D printing;bioinks;drug delivery;natural products;printability		Pharmaceutics	Department of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Technology, University of Seville, 41012 Seville, Spain.;Department of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Technology, University of Seville, 41012 Seville, Spain.;Department of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Technology, University of Seville, 41012 Seville, Spain.;Department of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Technology, University of Seville, 41012 Seville, Spain.

32628556	Our aim is to define the design and procedure of a 3D printed assistive device and to produce a prototype assistive device for an individual with quadriplegia in order to enable him/her to independently conduct daily living activities. For the design and production of the 3D assistive device, we followed six steps. In the first step-determination of problematic activity/client-centered approach-writing activity was determined as the most problematic activity as a result of the interview with a paraplegic patient. Then, 2D drawings of the assistive device were created as the second step. For the third step the 3D scan of the individual's right hand was obtained. 3D scan of the right hand was transferred to CATIA program and the 3D printer is used in the manufacturing process for the fourth step. In the fifth step, we produced a low-cost novel writing assistive device. The writing device was introduced to the disabled individual and training was given regarding its practical use in the final step teaching the use of the device. As 3D printing technology progresses and becomes more reliable, we believe that the production of assistive devices will become much easier and their use will become more prevalent.

32615543	Electrohydrodynamic (EHD) printing is a newly emerging additive manufacturing strategy for the controlled fabrication of three-dimensional (3D) micro/nanoscale architectures. This unique superiority makes it particularly suitable for the biofabrication of artificial tissue analogs with biomimetic structural organizations similar to the scales of native extracellular matrix (ECM) or living cells, which shows great potentials to precisely regulate cellular behaviors and tissue regeneration. Here the state-of-the-art advancements of high-resolution EHD bioprinting were reviewed mainly including melt-based and solution-based processes for the fabrication of micro/nanoscale fibrous scaffolds and living tissues constructs. The related printing materials, innovations on structure design and printing processes, functionalization of the resultant architectures as well as their effects on the mechanical and biological properties of the EHD-printed structures were introduced and analyzed. The recent explorations on the EHD cell printing for high-resolution cell-laden microgel patterning and 3D construct fabrication were highlighted. The major challenges as well as possible solutions to translate EHD bioprinting into a mature and prevalent biofabrication strategy were finally discussed.

32599574	Towards the development of in vivo-mimicking tumor model for extensive study of tumorigenesis and establishment of personalized therapy, patient-derived primary tumor cells were employed in this work for three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting. Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma cells isolated from patient were bioprinted using a composite hydrogel system of gelatin-alginate-MatrigelTM into pre-designed grid architecture. ICC cells were observed to process a colony forming ability with high survival rate and active proliferation. Expression levels of tumor markers, cancer stem cell markers, matrix metalloproteinase protein, index of tumor fibrosis, index of liver function, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition regulatory proteins confirmed the development of the invasive and metastatic phenotype of the intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma cells in the 3D printed tumor microenvironment. Similar results were obtained in anti-cancer drug resistance of the intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma cells in the 3D bioprinted construct that demonstrated stem-like properties, which suggested the promising potential of current 3D printed tumor model in the development of personalized therapy, especially for discovery of more conducive targeted drugs.

32567810	Living materials are created through the embedding of live, whole cells into a matrix that can house and sustain the viability of the encapsulated cells. Through the immobilization of these cells, their bioactivity can be harnessed for applications such as bioreactors for the production of high-value chemicals. While the interest in living materials is growing, many existing materials lack robust structure and are difficult to pattern. Furthermore, many living materials employ only one type of microorganism, or microbial consortia with little control over the arrangement of the various cell types. In this work, a Pluronic F127-based hydrogel system is characterized for the encapsulation of algae, yeast, and bacteria to create living materials. This hydrogel system is also demonstrated to be an excellent material for additive manufacturing in the form of direct write 3D-printing to spatially arrange the cells within a single printed construct. These living materials allow for the development of incredibly complex, immobilized consortia, and the results detailed herein further enhance the understanding of how cells behave within living material matrices. The utilization of these materials allows for interesting applications of multikingdom microbial cultures in immobilized bioreactor or biosensing technologies.

32558555	The field of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine has made numerous advances in recent years in the arena of fabricating multifunctional, three-dimensional (3D) tissue constructs. This can be attributed to novel approaches in the bioprinting of stem cells. There are expansive options in bioprinting technology that have become more refined and specialized over the years, and stem cells address many limitations in cell source, expansion, and development of bioengineered tissue constructs. While bioprinted stem cells present an opportunity to replicate physiological microenvironments with precision, the future of this practice relies heavily on the optimization of the cellular microenvironment. To fabricate tissue constructs that are useful in replicating physiological conditions in laboratory settings, or in preparation for transplantation to a living host, the microenvironment must mimic conditions that allow bioprinted stem cells to proliferate, differentiate, and migrate. The advances of bioprinting stem cells and directing cell fate have the potential to provide feasible and translatable approach to creating complex tissues and organs. This review will examine the methods through which bioprinted stem cells are differentiated into desired cell lineages through biochemical, biological, and biomechanical techniques.

32543408	Biliary tract rhabdomyosarcoma is a soft tissue malignant musculoskeletal tumor which is located in the biliary tract. Although this tumor represents less than 1% of the total amount of childhood cancers, when localized, a >70% overall 5-year survival rate, the resection is clinically challenging and complications might exist during the biliary obstruction. Although surgery remains a mainstay, complete tumor resection is generally difficult to achieve without mutilation and severe long-term sequelae. Therefore, manufacturing multi-material 3D surgical planning prototypes of the case provides a great opportunity for surgeons to learn beforehand what they can expect. Additionally, practicing before the operation enhances the probability of success. That is why different compositions of materials have been characterized to match the mechanical properties of the liver. To do this, Dynamic Mechanical Analysis (DMA) tests and Shore hardness tests have been carried out. Amongst the material samples produced, 6%wt PVA (poly vinyl alcohol)/1%wt PHY (Phytagel)-1FT (Freeze-Thaw cycles) and 1%wt agarose appear as the best options for mimicking the liver tissue in terms of viscoelasticity. Regarding the Shore hardness, the best solution is 1%wt agarose. Additionally, a surgical planning prototype using this last material mentioned was manufactured and validated using a CT (Computed Tomography) scanner. In most of the structures the difference between the 3D model and the organ in terms of dimensions is less than 3.35 mm, which represents a low dimensional error, around 1%. On the other hand, the total manufacturing cost of the 3D physical model was €513 which is relatively low in comparison with other technologies.	3D printed soft surgical planning prototype for a biliary tract rhabdomyosarcoma.	2020	Sep	Tejo-Otero A;Lustig-Gainza P;Fenollosa-Artés F;Valls A;Krauel L;Buj-Corral I	Additive manufacturing;Biliary tract rhabdomyosarcoma;Liver;Mimicking;Soft living tissues;Surgical planning	Biliary Tract;Humans;Printing, Three-Dimensional;Rhabdomyosarcoma;Tomography, X-Ray Computed	Journal of the mechanical behavior of biomedical materials	Centre CIM, Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (CIM UPC), Carrer de Llorens i Artigas, 12, 08028, Barcelona, Spain.

32525868	Creating a secure and comfortable linkage between the residual limb and prosthetic socket in persons with lower limb amputation is a critical factor for successful rehabilitation, including ambulation and other activities of daily living. Unwanted rotation within the socket can be a clinical problem for prosthesis users. One way of addressing issues experienced with transverse plane control of the socket may be through increased friction interface forces. It has been proposed that friction at the residual limb/socket interface may be increased by adding texture to interface components. Three-dimensional (3D) printing may be used to fabricate sockets with texture patterns added to the inner socket surface. Hence, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of socket texturing on transverse plane rotation of the socket on a mock residual limb under two suspension conditions: passive suction and active vacuum. To conduct this study, we developed a mechanical testing protocol as no standardized tests currently exist to assess prosthetic sockets. Sockets with 14 different texture patterns were fabricated using the Squirt-Shape™ 3D printer. Textured sockets were compared to an Original Squirt-Shape (OSS) socket and a smooth thermoformed socket. Sockets were fitted with a mock residual limb and bi-axially loaded to 350 N compression with simultaneous rotation (2.5°, 5° and 7.5°) using a custom rotation assembly attached to a uniaxial hydraulic material testing system. There was a statistically significant three-way interaction between suspension, angle and texture (p < 0.0005). Torques between textured and reference sockets, for all rotation angles and both suspension conditions, were significantly different (p < 0.0005). Using newly developed testing protocols, it was demonstrated that some texture patterns significantly increased torque (i.e., resistance against unwanted rotation) in the transverse plane compared to both OSS and smooth sockets, especially for passive suction. Rotation testing of sockets may provide insight into socket design to improve suspension in the transverse plane.

32515582	"Producing artificial multicellular structures to process multistep cascade reactions and mimic the fundamental aspects of living systems is an outstanding challenge. Highly biocompatible, artificial systems consisting of all-aqueous, compartmentalized multicellular systems have yet to be realized. Here, a rapid multilevel compartmentalization of an all-aqueous system where a 3D sheet of subcolloidosomes encloses a mother colloidosome by interfacial phase separation is demonstrated. These spatially organized multicellular structures are termed ""blastosomes"" since they are similar to blastula in appearance. The barrier to nanoparticle assembly at the water-water interface is overcome using oppositely charged polyelectrolytes that form a coacervate-nanoparticle-composite network. The conditions required to trigger interfacial phase separation and form blastosomes are quantified in a mapped state diagram.

32514393	The anatomical properties of the enthesis of the rotator cuff are hardly regained during the process of healing. The tendon-to-bone interface is normally replaced by fibrovascular tissue instead of interposition fibrocartilage, which impairs biomechanics in the shoulder and causes dysfunction. Tissue engineering offers a promising strategy to regenerate a biomimetic interface. Here, we report heterogeneous tendon-to-bone interface engineering based on a 3D-printed multiphasic scaffold.

32511894	The continuous progress of printing technologies over the past 20 years has fueled the development of a plethora of applications in materials sciences, flexible electronics, and biotechnologies. More recently, printing methodologies have started up to explore the world of Artificial Biology, offering new paradigms in the direct assembly of Artificial Biosystems (small condensates, compartments, networks, tissues, and organs) by mimicking the result of the evolution of living systems and also by redesigning natural biological systems, taking inspiration from them. This recent progress is reported in terms of a new field here defined as Printing Biology, resulting from the intersection between the field of printing and the bottom up Synthetic Biology. Printing Biology explores new approaches for the reconfigurable assembly of designed life-like or life-inspired structures. This work presents this emerging field, highlighting its main features, i.e., printing methodologies (from 2D to 3D), molecular ink properties, deposition mechanisms, and finally the applications and future challenges. Printing Biology is expected to show a growing impact on the development of biotechnology and life-inspired fabrication.

32484194	3D Bioprinting is expected to become a strong tool for regenerative medicine, but satisfactory bioinks for the printing of constructs containing living cells are lacking due to the rigorous requirement of high printability and biocompatibility, which are often contradictory. Here, we have reported the development of a novel hybrid bioink by combining rigid gellan gum (GG), flexible sodium alginate (SA), and a bioactive substance thixotropic magnesium phosphate-based gel (TMP-BG). The ratio of these components was first optimized to obtain satisfactory gelating, mechanical, rheological, and printing properties. The formulated hybrid GG-SA/TMP-BG bioink had a good printability due to the shear-thinning and its multiple cross-linking by Mg2+ and Ca2+. The tunable mechanical performance of the hybrid bioink could simulate various extracellular matrices of the different tissues and support integrity of 3D printing constructs. Moreover, the hybrid bioink induced apatite deposition during immersion in simulated body fluids, and also promoted cell proliferation in vitro. MG-63 osteosarcoma cells were dispersed in the bioink and printed into 3D constructs. The cells exhibited good cell survival due to the shear-thinning property of the bioink and the ion concentration used for cross-linking. The proliferation rate of the cells also significantly exceeded those in non-printed samples. Confocal microscopy revealed a homogeneous distribution of cells in the printed constructs, and survival for more than 7 d. In vivo animal experiments showed that the hybrid bioink without cells could induce osteochondral repair. Therefore, this hybrid bioink has good printability, biocompatibility, mechanical support, and bioactivity, which is expected to have promising applications in 3D bioprinting.	3D Bioprinting of shear-thinning hybrid bioinks with excellent bioactivity derived from gellan/alginate and thixotropic magnesium phosphate-based gels.	2020	Jul	Chen You;Xiong Xiong;Liu Xin;Cui Rongwei;Wang Chen;Zhao Guoru;Zhi Wei;Lu Mengjie;Duan Ke;Weng Jie;Qu Shuxin;Ge Jianhua		Alginates;Bioprinting;Cells, Cultured;Gels;Humans;Ink;Magnesium Compounds;Molecular Structure;Particle Size;Phosphates;Polysaccharides, Bacterial;Printing, Three-Dimensional;Surface Properties	Journal of materials chemistry.

32470967	Studying biological characteristics of tumors and evaluating the treatment effects require appropriate in vitro tumor models. However, the occurrence, progression, and migration of tumors involve spatiotemporal changes, cell-microenvironment and cell-cell interactions, and signal transmission in cells, which makes the construction of in vitro tumor models extremely challenging. In the past few years, advances in biomaterials and tissue engineering methods, especially development of the bioprinting technology, have paved the way for innovative platform technologies for in vitro cancer research. Bioprinting can accurately control the distribution of cells, active molecules, and biomaterials. Furthermore, this technology recapitulates the key characteristics of the tumor microenvironment and constructs in vitro tumor models with bionic structures and physiological systems. These models can be used as robust platforms to study tumor initiation, interaction with the microenvironment, angiogenesis, motility and invasion, as well as intra- and extravasation. Bioprinted tumor models can also be used for high-throughput drug screening and validation and provide the possibility for personalized cancer treatment research. This review describes the basic characteristics of the tumor and its microenvironment and focuses on the importance and relevance of bioprinting technology in the construction of tumor models. Research progress in the bioprinting of monocellular, multicellular, and personalized tumor models is discussed, and comprehensive application of bioprinting in preclinical drug screening and innovative therapy is reviewed. Finally, we offer our perspective on the shortcomings of the existing models and explore new technologies to outline the direction of future development and application prospects of next-generation tumor models.

32466965	Most available 3D biofabrication technologies rely on single-component deposition methods, such as inkjet, extrusion, or light-assisted printing. It is unlikely that any of these technologies used individually would be able to replicate the complexity and functionality of living tissues. Recently, new biofabrication approaches have emerged that integrate multiple manufacturing technologies into a single biofabrication platform. This has led to fabricated structures with improved functionality. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of recent advances in the integration of different manufacturing technologies with the aim to fabricate more functional tissue structures. We provide our vision on the future of additive manufacturing (AM) technology, digital design, and the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in the field of biofabrication.

32464607	We develop and characterize a biomaterial formulation and robotic methods tailored for intracorporeal tissue engineering (TE) via direct-write (DW) 3D printing. Intracorporeal TE is defined as the biofabrication of 3D TE scaffolds inside of a living patient, in a minimally invasive manner. A biomaterial for intracorporeal TE requires to be 3D printable and crosslinkable via mechanisms that are safe to native tissues and feasible at physiological temperature (37 °C). The cell-laden biomaterial (bioink) preparation and bioprinting methods must support cell viability. Additionally, the biomaterial and bioprinting method must enable the spatially accurate intracorporeal 3D delivery of the biomaterial, and the biomaterial must adhere to or integrate into the native tissue. Current biomaterial formulations do not meet all the presumed intracorporeal DW TE requirements. We demonstrate that a specific formulation of gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA)/Laponite®/methylcellulose (GLM) biomaterial system can be 3D printed at physiological temperature and crosslinked using visible light to construct 3D TE scaffolds with clinically relevant dimensions and consistent structures. Cell viability of 71%-77% and consistent mechanical properties over 21 d are reported. Rheological modifiers, Laponite® and methylcellulose, extend the degradation time of the scaffolds. The DW modality enables the piercing of the soft tissue and over-extrusion of the biomaterial into the tissue, creating a novel interlocking mechanism with soft, hydrated native tissue mimics and animal muscle with a 3.5-4 fold increase in the biomaterial/tissue adhesion strength compared to printing on top of the tissue. The developed GLM biomaterial and robotic interlocking mechanism pave the way towards intracorporeal TE.

32434160	Recent research has been focusing on the generation of living personalized osteochondral constructs for joint repair. Native articular cartilage has a zonal structure, which is not reflected in current constructs and which may be a cause of the frequent failure of these repair attempts. Therefore, we investigated the performance of a composite implant that further reflects the zonal distribution of cellular component both in vitro and in vivo in a long-term equine model. Constructs constituted of a 3D-printed poly(ϵ-caprolactone) (PCL) bone anchor from which reinforcing fibers protruded into the chondral part of the construct over which two layers of a thiol-ene cross-linkable hyaluronic acid/poly(glycidol) hybrid hydrogel (HA-SH/P(AGE-co-G)) were fabricated. The top layer contained Articular Cartilage Progenitor Cells (ACPCs) derived from the superficial layer of native cartilage tissue, the bottom layer contained mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs). The chondral part of control constructs were homogeneously filled with MSCs. After six months in vivo, microtomography revealed significant bone growth into the anchor. Histologically, there was only limited production of cartilage-like tissue (despite persistency of hydrogel) both in zonal and non-zonal constructs. There were no differences in histological scoring; however, the repair tissue was significantly stiffer in defects repaired with zonal constructs. The sub-optimal quality of the repair tissue may be related to several factors, including early loss of implanted cells, or inappropriate degradation rate of the hydrogel. Nonetheless, this approach may be promising and research into further tailoring of biomaterials and of construct characteristics seems warranted.

32409053	Cell therapy is a promising strategy in which living cells or cellular materials are delivered to treat a variety of diseases. Here, we developed an electrospray bioprinting method to rapidly generate cell-laden hydrogel microspheres, which limit the migration of the captured cells and provide an immunologically privileged microenvironment for cell survival in vivo. Currently, therapeutic angiogenesis aims to induce collateral vessel formation after limb ischemia. However, the clinical application of gene and cell therapy has been impeded by concerns regarding its inefficacy, as well as the associated risk of immunogenicity and oncogenicity. In this study, hydrogel microspheres encapsulating VEGF-overexpressing HEK293T cells showed good safety via subcutaneously injecting into male C57BL/6 mice. In addition, these cell-modified microspheres effectively promoted angiogenesis in a mouse hind-limb ischemia model. Therefore, we demonstrated the great therapeutic potential of this approach to induce angiogenesis in limb ischemia, indicating that bioprinting has a bright future in cell therapy.

32407396	Soft robotic hands with monolithic structure have shown great potential to be used as prostheses due to their advantages to yield light weight and compact designs as well as its ease of manufacture. However, existing soft prosthetic hands design were often not geared towards addressing some of the practical requirements highlighted in prosthetics research. The gap between the existing designs and the practical requirements significantly hampers the potential to transfer these designs to real-world applications. This work addressed these requirements with the consideration of the trade-off between practicality and performance. These requirements were achieved through exploiting the monolithic 3D printing of soft materials which incorporates membrane enclosed flexure joints in the finger designs, synergy-based thumb motion and cable-driven actuation system in the proposed hand prosthesis. Our systematic design (tentatively named X-Limb) achieves a weight of 253gr, three grasps types (with capability of individual finger movement), power-grip force of 21.5N, finger flexion speed of 1.3sec, a minimum grasping cycles of 45,000 (while maintaining its original functionality) and a bill of material cost of 200 USD (excluding quick disconnect wrist but without factoring in the cost reduction through mass production). A standard Activities Measure for Upper-Limb Amputees benchmark test was carried out to evaluate the capability of X-Limb in performing grasping task required for activities of daily living. The results show that all the practical design requirements are satisfied, and the proposed soft prosthetic hand is able to perform all the real-world grasping tasks of the benchmark tests, showing great potential in improving life quality of individuals with upper limb loss.

32399041	3D bioprinting offers interesting opportunities for 3D tissue printing by providing living cells with appropriate scaffolds with a dedicated structure. Biological advances in bioinks are currently promising for cell encapsulation, particularly that of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). We present herein the development of cartilage implants by 3D bioprinting that deliver MSCs encapsulated in an original bioink at low concentration. 3D-bioprinted constructs (10 × 10 × 4 mm) were printed using alginate/gelatin/fibrinogen bioink mixed with human bone marrow MSCs. The influence of the bioprinting process and chondrogenic differentiation on MSC metabolism, gene profiles, and extracellular matrix (ECM) production at two different MSC concentrations (1 million or 2 million cells/mL) was assessed on day 28 (D28) by using MTT tests, real-time RT-PCR, and histology and immunohistochemistry, respectively. Then, the effect of the environment (growth factors such as TGF-β1/3 and/or BMP2 and oxygen tension) on chondrogenicity was evaluated at a 1 M cell/mL concentration on D28 and D56 by measuring mitochondrial activity, chondrogenic gene expression, and the quality of cartilaginous matrix synthesis. We confirmed the safety of bioextrusion and gelation at concentrations of 1 million and 2 million MSC/mL in terms of cellular metabolism. The chondrogenic effect of TGF-β1 was verified within the substitute on D28 by measuring chondrogenic gene expression and ECM synthesis (glycosaminoglycans and type II collagen) on D28. The 1 M concentration represented the best compromise. We then evaluated the influence of various environmental factors on the substitutes on D28 (differentiation) and D56 (synthesis). Chondrogenic gene expression was maximal on D28 under the influence of TGF-β1 or TGF-β3 either alone or in combination with BMP-2. Hypoxia suppressed the expression of hypertrophic and osteogenic genes. ECM synthesis was maximal on D56 for both glycosaminoglycans and type II collagen, particularly in the presence of a combination of TGF-β1 and BMP-2. Continuous hypoxia did not influence matrix synthesis but significantly reduced the appearance of microcalcifications within the extracellular matrix. The described strategy is very promising for 3D bioprinting by the bioextrusion of an original bioink containing a low concentration of MSCs followed by the culture of the substitutes in hypoxic conditions under the combined influence of TGF-β1 and BMP-2.

32388202	Bioprinting is an advanced fabrication approach to engineer complex living structures as the conventional fabrication methods are incapable of integrating structural and biological complexities. It offers the versatility of printing different cell incorporated hydrogels (bioink) layer by layer; offering control over spatial resolution and cell distribution to mimic native tissue architectures. However, the bioprinting of tough hydrogels involve additional complexities, such as employing complex crosslinking or reinforcing mechanisms during printing and pre/post printing cellular activities. Solving this complexity requires attention from engineering, material science and cell biology perspectives. In this review, we discuss different types of bioprinting techniques with focus on current state-of-the-art in bioink formulations and pivotal characteristics of bioinks for tough hydrogel printing. We discuss the scope of transition from 3D to 4D bioprinting and some of the advanced characterization techniques for in-depth understanding of the 3D printing process from the microstructural perspective, along with few specific applications and conclude with the future perspectives in biofabrication of hydrogels for tissue engineering applications.

32330139	The threat of arsenic contamination to public health, particularly in developing countries, has become a serious problem. Millions of people in their daily lives are still highly dependent on groundwater containing high levels of arsenic, which causes excessive exposure to this toxic element, due to the high cost and lack of water-treatment infrastructures. Therefore, a technique for large-scale treatment of water in rural areas to remove arsenic is needed and should be low-cost, be easily customized, and not rely on electrical power. In this study, in an effort to fulfill those requirements, we introduce a three-dimensional (3D), printed water-filtration system for arsenic removal. Three-dimensional printing can provide a compact, customized filtration system that can fulfill the above-mentioned requirements and that can be made from plastic materials, which are abundant. Armed with the versatility of 3D printing, we were able to design the internal surface areas of filters, after which we modified the surfaces of the 3D, printed filters by using iron (III) oxide as an adsorbent for arsenite. We investigated the effects of the controlled surface area on the flow rate and the deposition of the adsorbent, which are directly related to the adsorption of arsenic. We conducted isotherm studies to quantify the adsorption of arsenic on our 3D, printed filtration system.

32323035	For multicenter clinical studies, PET/CT and SPECT/CT scanners need to be validated to ensure comparability between various scanner types and brands. This validation is usually performed using hollow phantoms filled with radioactive liquids. In recent years, 3D printing technology has gained increasing popularity for manufacturing of phantoms, as it is cost-efficient and allows preparation of phantoms of almost any shape. So far, however, direct 3D printing with radioactive building materials has not yet been reported. The aim of this work was to develop a procedure for preparation of 99mTc-containing building materials and demonstrate successful application of this material for 3D printing of several test objects.	3D printing of radioactive phantoms for nuclear medicine imaging.	2020	Apr	Läppchen Tilman;Meier Lorenz P;Fürstner Markus;Prenosil George A;Krause Thomas;Rominger Axel;Klaeser Bernd;Hentschel Michael	3D printing;Phantom;Printer ink;Resin monomer;SPECT;Scanner validation;Technetium-99m		EJNMMI physics	Department of Nuclear Medicine, Inselspital, Bern University Hospital, University of Bern, CH-3010, Bern, Switzerland. tilman.laeppchen@insel.ch.;Department of Nuclear Medicine, Inselspital, Bern University Hospital, University of Bern, CH-3010, Bern, Switzerland.;Department of Nuclear Medicine, Inselspital, Bern University Hospital, University of Bern, CH-3010, Bern, Switzerland.;Department of Nuclear Medicine, Inselspital, Bern University Hospital, University of Bern, CH-3010, Bern, Switzerland.;Department of Nuclear Medicine, Inselspital, Bern University Hospital, University of Bern, CH-3010, Bern, Switzerland.;Department of Nuclear Medicine, Inselspital, Bern University Hospital, University of Bern, CH-3010, Bern, Switzerland.;Department of Nuclear Medicine, Inselspital, Bern University Hospital, University of Bern, CH-3010, Bern, Switzerland.;Department of Nuclear Medicine, Inselspital, Bern University Hospital, University of Bern, CH-3010, Bern, Switzerland.

35493638	Tissue engineering has emerged as a promising approach for soft tissue regeneration. Three-dimensional (3D) cell printing showed great potential for producing cell-encapsulated scaffolds to repair tissue defects. The advantage of 3D cell printing technology is precise cell loading in scaffolds to achieve tissue regeneration instead of only relying on the cells from surrounding tissue or blood. A new acellular dermal matrix/gelatin-sodium alginate (ADM/A/G) scaffold with living gingival fibroblasts was constructed by 3D cell printing technology for potential oral soft tissue regeneration in this study, and the biological characteristics of the 3D cell printing scaffolds were evaluated. The residue of nucleic acid and growth factors in ADM were detected. Three biomaterials were mixed at an appropriate radio with human gingival fibroblasts (hGFs) to prepare bioinks. Two kinds of layer scaffolds were fabricated by 3D cell printing technology. The mechanical strength and degradability of the scaffolds were determined by measuring their compressive modulus and mass loss. CCK-8 assay and calcein-AM/PI staining were conducted to detect the cell proliferation and viability in 3D cell printing scaffolds. The morphology of the hGFs in the scaffolds were observed using SEM and FITC-phalloidin staining. The expression of COL1A1, PECAM1, and VEGF-A of hGFs in the scaffolds were quantified by qRT-PCR. The gelatin-sodium alginate (A/G) scaffolds were used as control group in all experiments. Compared with the control group, 3D cell printing ADM/A/G scaffolds showed better mechanical strength and longer degradation time. The ADM/A/G scaffolds obviously had a better promotion effect on cell proliferation and viability. Most of the hGFs observed had a fully extended spindle morphology in the ADM/A/G scaffolds but oval morphology in the control group. The expression of COL1A1 was significantly higher than in the control group with time, and the expression of PECAM1 and VEGF-A was slightly higher in ADM/A/G scaffolds on day 14. 3D cell printing gingival fibroblast-ADM/A/G scaffolds showed excellent biological properties, which could be potentially useful in oral soft tissue regeneration.

32273516	Corals have evolved as optimized photon augmentation systems, leading to space-efficient microalgal growth and outstanding photosynthetic quantum efficiencies. Light attenuation due to algal self-shading is a key limiting factor for the upscaling of microalgal cultivation. Coral-inspired light management systems could overcome this limitation and facilitate scalable bioenergy and bioproduct generation. Here, we develop 3D printed bionic corals capable of growing microalgae with high spatial cell densities of up to 109 cells mL-1. The hybrid photosynthetic biomaterials are produced with a 3D bioprinting platform which mimics morphological features of living coral tissue and the underlying skeleton with micron resolution, including their optical and mechanical properties. The programmable synthetic microenvironment thus allows for replicating both structural and functional traits of the coral-algal symbiosis. Our work defines a class of bionic materials that is capable of interacting with living organisms and can be exploited for applied coral reef research and photobioreactor design.

32240195	Cryopreservation is a method used for preserving living cells by cooling them to very low temperatures. Although cryopreservation methods for oocytes and embryos have been developed for use in reproductive medicine, there are no established methods yet for preserving cell aggregates (spheroids) in regenerative medicine. We have developed a bio-three-dimensional (3D) printer that can fabricate scaffold-free 3D constructs by loading spheroids onto a needle array. We fabricated several constructs such as blood vessels, liver, diaphragm, and a conduit for nerves by using this method. These constructs have the potential to be applied in patients. However, the process of fabricating tissue constructs (harvesting cells, expanding cells, making spheroids using cultured cells, printing constructs, and maturing constructs) is time-consuming. Therefore, cryopreservation methods for spheroids or constructs should be developed to increase the efficiency of this method for clinical use. Here, we developed a method for cryopreserving spheroids, which were then used to fabricate constructs. Fibroblast cell-based spheroids were cryopreserved in phosphate-buffered saline or cryopreservation solution at -80°C for 1 week. After thawing, spheroids in cryopreservation solution began to fuse on day 1. Cryopreserved spheroids were printed onto a needle array to fabricate a scaffold-free tubular construct using a bio-3D printer. After 7 days, the printed spheroids fused and formed scaffold-free constructs. We confirmed the viability of cells in the cryopreserved spheroids and fabricated tubular constructs. Our results indicate that spheroids can be cryopreserved and used to prepare scaffold-free constructs for clinical use.

32224513	This paper introduces the concept of continuous chaotic printing, i.e. the use of chaotic flows for deterministic and continuous extrusion of fibers with internal multilayered micro- or nanostructures. Two free-flowing materials are coextruded through a printhead containing a miniaturized Kenics static mixer (KSM) composed of multiple helicoidal elements. This produces a fiber with a well-defined internal multilayer microarchitecture at high-throughput (>1.0 m min-1). The number of mixing elements and the printhead diameter determine the number and thickness of the internal lamellae, which are generated according to successive bifurcations that yield a vast amount of inter-material surface area (∼102 cm2 cm-3) at high resolution (∼10 µm). This creates structures with extremely high surface area to volume ratio (SAV). Comparison of experimental and computational results demonstrates that continuous chaotic 3D printing is a robust process with predictable output. In an exciting new development, we demonstrate a method for scaling down these microstructures by 3 orders of magnitude, to the nanoscale level (∼150 nm), by feeding the output of a continuous chaotic 3D printhead into an electrospinner. The simplicity and high resolution of continuous chaotic printing strongly supports its potential use in novel applications, including-but not limited to-bioprinting of multi-scale layered biological structures such as bacterial communities, living tissues composed of organized multiple mammalian cell types, and fabrication of smart multi-material and multilayered constructs for biomedical applications.

32218984	Phase microscopy allows stain-free imaging of transparent biological samples. One technique, using the transport of intensity equation (TIE), can be performed without dedicated hardware by simply processing pairs of images taken at known spacings within the sample. The resulting TIE images are quantitative phase maps of unstained biological samples. Therefore, spatially resolved optical path length (OPL) information can also be determined. Using low-cost, open-source hardware, we applied the TIE to living algal cells to measure their effect on OPL. We obtained OPL values that were repeatable within species and differed by distinct amounts depending on the species being measured. We suggest TIE imaging as a method of discrimination between different algal species and, potentially, non-biological materials, based on refractive index/OPL. Potential applications in biogeochemical modelling and climate sciences are suggested.

32207105	3D bioprinting involves engineering live cells into a 3D structure, using a 3D printer to print cells, often together with a compatible 3D scaffold. 3D-printed cells and tissues may be used for a range of purposes including medical research, in vitro drug testing, and in vivo transplantation. The inclusion of living cells and biomaterials in the 3D printing process raises ethical, policy, and regulatory issues at each stage of the bioprinting process that include the source of cells and materials, stability and biocompatibility of cells and materials, disposal of 3D-printed materials, intended use, and long-term effects. This chapter focuses on the ethical issues that arise from 3D bioprinting in the lab-from consideration of the source of cells and materials, ensuring their quality and safety, through to testing of bioprinted materials in animal and human trials. It also provides guidance on where to seek information concerning appropriate regulatory frameworks and guidelines, including on classification and patenting of 3D-bioprinted materials, and identifies regulatory gaps that deserve attention.

32182593	3D bioprinting may revolutionize the field of tissue engineering by allowing fabrication of bio-structures with a high degree of complexity, fine architecture and heterogeneous composition. The printing substances in these processes are mostly based on biomaterials and living cells. As such, they generally possess weak mechanical properties and thus must be supported during fabrication in order to prevent the collapse of large, volumetric multi-layered printouts. In this work, we characterize a uniquely formulated media used to support printing of extracellular matrix-based biomaterials. We show that a hybrid material, comprised of calcium-alginate nanoparticles and xanthan gum, presents superb qualities that enable printing at high resolution of down to 10 microns, allowing fabrication of complex constructs and cellular structures. This hybrid also presents an exclusive combination of desirable properties such as biocompatibility, high transparency, stability at a wide range of temperatures and amenability to delicate extraction procedures. Moreover, as fabrication of large, volumetric biological structures may require hours and even days to accomplish, we have demonstrated that the hybrid medium can support prolonged, precise printing for at least 18 h. All these qualities make it a promising support medium for 3D printing of tissues and organs.

32143204	The development of 3D Cell-printing technology contributes to the application of tissue constructs in vitro in neuroscience. Collecting neural cells from patients is an efficient way of monitoring health of an individual target, which, in turn, benefits the enhancement of medicines. The fabricated sample of neural cells is exposed to potential drugs for the analysis of neuron responses. 3D cell-printing as an emerging biofabrication technology has been widely used to mimic natural 3D models in in vitro tissue research, especially in vitro brain-like tissue constructs in neuroscience. Fabricated brain-like tissue constructs provide a 3D microenvironment for primary neural cells to grow within. After more than several weeks of in vitro culturing, the formation of neural circuits in structures equips them with the capability of sensitively responding to a stimulus. In this study, an in vitro layered brain-like tissue construct is first proposed and later developed by 3D cell-printing technology. The layered structure is systematically analyzed, starting from printing parameter optimization to biological functionality performance. The optimized diameter of printing nozzle and printing speed are 0.51 mm and 5 μl s-1, respectively, and the elastic modulus is approximately 6 kPa. Live/dead and immunostaining imaging is used to verify the growth of neural cells in the printed structure. The survival rate of neural cells in 2D and 3D samples is compared, and the results demonstrate that the 3D-printed structures exhibit a better artificial culturing environment and a higher survival rate. Both 2D and 3D samples are directly cultured in a 4 × 4 multiple electrode array. Local field potentials are collected and validated by the Med64 recording system. Tetrodotoxin is used to test the drug sensitivity of the printed structure, and the excitatory postsynaptic potential signals of the physiological performance indicate that the 3D-printed structure has great potential as a drug testing model in the pharmaypeceutical study.

32110730	Grippers are widely used for the gripping, manipulation, and assembly of objects with a wide range of scales, shapes, and quantities in research, industry, and our daily lives. A simple yet universal solution is very challenging. Here, we manage to address this challenge utilizing a simple shape memory polymer (SMP) block. The embedding of objects into the SMP enables the gripping while the shape recovery upon stimulation facilitates the releasing. Systematic studies show that friction, suction, and interlocking effects dominate the grip force individually or collectively. This universal SMP gripper design provides a versatile solution to grip and manipulate multiscaled (from centimeter scale down to 10-μm scale) 3D objects with arbitrary shapes, in individual, deterministic, or massive, selective ways. These extraordinary capabilities are demonstrated by the gripping and manipulation of macroscaled objects, mesoscaled steel sphere arrays and microparticles, and the selective and patterned transfer printing of micro light-emitting diodes.

32105403	Giant unilamellar phospholipid vesicles are attractive starting points for constructing minimal living cells from the bottom-up. Their membranes are compatible with many physiologically functional modules and act as selective barriers, while retaining a high morphological flexibility. However, their spherical shape renders them rather inappropriate to study phenomena that are based on distinct cell shape and polarity, such as cell division. Here, a microscale device based on 3D printed protein hydrogel is introduced to induce pH-stimulated reversible shape changes in trapped vesicles without compromising their free-standing membranes. Deformations of spheres to at least twice their aspect ratio, but also toward unusual quadratic or triangular shapes can be accomplished. Mechanical force induced by the cages to phase-separated membrane vesicles can lead to spontaneous shape deformations, from the recurrent formation of dumbbells with curved necks between domains to full budding of membrane domains as separate vesicles. Moreover, shape-tunable vesicles are particularly desirable when reconstituting geometry-sensitive protein networks, such as reaction-diffusion systems. In particular, vesicle shape changes allow to switch between different modes of self-organized protein oscillations within, and thus, to influence reaction networks directly by external mechanical cues.

32100676	The aim of this feasibility study was to investigate how a 3D printer could be put to its best use in a resource-limited healthcare setting. We have examined whether a 3D printer can contribute to making prostheses, braces, or splints for patients who underwent major limb amputation because of complex wounds, for example, due to burns and subsequent scarring, accidents, conflicts, or congenital abnormalities. During a 3-month period, we investigated the benefits of customized, 3D-printed arm prostheses, splints, and braces in Sierra Leone. Using a handheld 3D scanner and a 3D printer, patient-specific medical aids were designed, manufactured, and tested. Questionnaires regarding patient satisfaction and the functionality of the prostheses were used for a short-term follow-up. Four esthetic prostheses were designed: two prostheses of the hand, one of the forearm, and one of the entire arm. Follow-ups were conducted after 3 to 4 weeks to investigate the quality of the prostheses and to complete a patient questionnaire. Even though the prostheses primarily fulfill esthetic needs, they also exhibit some degree of functionality. In addition, four splints for hands and arms were made to prevent scar contractures after skin transplantation. Finally, a brace for a young boy with kyphoscoliosis was manufactured. The boy has accepted the brace and will be followed up in the months to come. Long-term follow-up is required to prove the sustainability of the 3D-printed brace and prosthetic arms. Further research into how to sustain and refine this project is underway.

32096656	We designed and fabricated, using low-cost 3D printing technologies, a device that enables direct control of cell density in epithelial monolayers. The device operates by varying the tension of a silicone substrate upon which the cells are adhered. Multiple devices can be manufactured easily and placed in any standard incubator. This allows long-term culturing of cells on pretensioned substrates until the user decreases the tension, thereby inducing compressive forces in plane and subsequent instantaneous cell crowding. Moreover, the low-profile device is completely portable and can be mounted directly onto an inverted optical microscope. This enables visualization of the morphology and dynamics of living cells in stretched or compressed conditions using a wide range of high-resolution microscopy techniques.	3D-printable cell crowding device enables imaging of live cells in compression.	2020	May	Dow Liam P;Khankhel Aimal H;Abram John;Valentine Megan T	3D printing;cell compression;epithelial mechanics;mechanobiology;microscopy	Animals;Biomechanical Phenomena;Cell Culture Techniques;Dogs;Equipment Design;Madin Darby Canine Kidney Cells;Microscopy;Printing, Three-Dimensional	BioTechniques	Biomolecular Science & Engineering Program, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA 93106, USA.;Biomolecular Science & Engineering Program, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA 93106, USA.;Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA 93106, USA.;Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA 93106, USA.

32070610	Controlled printing of biodegradable and bioresorbable polymers at desired 3D scaffold is of great importance for cell growth and tissue regeneration. In this work, a novel electrohydrodynamic jet 3D printing technology with the resultant effect of electrohydrodynamic force and thermal convection was developed, and its feasibility to fabricate controllable filament composite scaffolds was verified. This method introduces an effective thermal field under the needle to simultaneously enhance the ink viscosity, jetting morphology controllability and printing structure solidify. The fabrication mechanisms of thermal convection on jetting morphology and printed structures feature were investigated through theoretical analysis and experimental characterization. Under optimized conditions, a stable and finer jet was formed; then with the use of this jet, various 3D structures were directly printed at a high aspect ratio ~30. Furthermore, the PCL/PVP composite scaffolds with the controllable filament diameter (~10 μm) which is closed to living cells were printed. Cell culture experiments showed that the printed scaffolds had excellent cell biocompatibility and facilitated cellular proliferation in vitro. It is a great potential that the developed electrohydrodynamic jet 3D printing technology might provide a novel approach to directly print composite synthetic biopolymers into flexibly scale structures for tissue engineering applications.

32068328	We utilized patient-specific 3D liver models based on preoperative computed tomography images as intraoperative navigation and describe our experience. A 1-year and 10-month-old girl with situs inversus totalis underwent living donor liver transplantation for biliary atresia. Information on the hepatic artery, portal vein, inferior vena cava, and liver parenchyma was extracted and segmented from computed tomography images using liver analysis software. Laser lithography produced each 3D part of the liver from these data. The 3D models of each part of the liver were molded from polyurethane resin using different colors for each part and combined together, resulting in a patient-specific liver model. The industrial computed tomography scan of the patient-specific 3D liver model revealed that the gaps between the liver model and the original data were <0.4 mm in the 90% area, <0.8 mm in the 98% area, and 1.53 mm at the maximum. The 3D liver model was brought into the operative field and used as intraoperative navigation for total liver resection. The procedure was finished successfully without any major intraoperative complications. In conclusion, the 3D model facilitates the identification of vessels during operations; it is possible to promptly share patients' anatomy with the operative team.

32064791	Airway system is a vital part of the living being body. Trachea is the upper respiratory portion that connects nostril and lungs and has multiple functions such as breathing and entrapment of dust/pathogen particles. Tracheal reconstruction by artificial prosthesis, stents, and grafts are performed clinically for the repairing of damaged tissue. Although these (above-mentioned) methods repair the damaged parts, they have limited applicability like small area wounds and lack of functional tissue regeneration. Tissue engineering helps to overcome the above-mentioned problems by modifying the traditional used stents and grafts, not only repair but also regenerate the damaged area to functional tissue. Bioengineered tracheal replacements are biocompatible, nontoxic, porous, and having 3D biomimetic ultrastructure with good mechanical strength, which results in faster and better tissue regeneration. Till date, the bioengineered tracheal replacements studies have been going on preclinical and clinical levels. Besides that, still many researchers are working at advance level to make extracellular matrix-based acellular, 3D printed, cell-seeded grafts including living cells to overcome the demand of tissue or organ and making the ready to use tracheal reconstructs for clinical application. Thus, in this review, we summarized the tracheal tissue engineering aspects and their outcomes.

32059444	Arthropods, including pollinators and pests, have high positive and negative impacts on human well-being and the economy, and there is an increasing need to monitor their activity and population growth. The monitoring of arthropod species is a time-consuming and financially demanding process. Automatic detection can be a solution to this problem. Here, we describe the setup and operation mechanism of an infrared opto-electronic sensor-ring, which can be used for both small and large arthropods. The sensor-ring consists of 16 infrared (IR) photodiodes along a semicircle in front of an infrared LED. Using 3D printing, we constructed two types of sensor-ring: one with a wider sensing field for detection of large arthropods (flying, crawling, surface-living) in the size range of 2-35 mm; and another one with a narrower sensing field for soil microarthropods in the size range of 0.1-2 mm. We examined the detection accuracy and reliability of the two types of sensor-ring in the laboratory by using particles, and dead and living arthropods at two different sensitivity levels. For the wider sensor-ring, the 95% detectability level was reached with grain particles of 0.9 mm size. This result allowed us to detect all of the macroarthropods that were applied in the tests and that might be encountered in pest management. In the case of living microarthropods with different colors and shapes, when we used the narrower sensor-ring, we achieved the 95% detectability level at 1.1 mm, 0.9 mm, and 0.5 mm in the cases of F. candida, H. nitidus, and H. aculeifer, respectively. The unique potential of arthropod-detecting sensors lies in their real-time measurement system; the data are automatically forwarded to the server, and the end-user receives pest abundance data daily or even immediately. This technological innovation will allow us to make pest management more effective.

32039181	As a cellular-assembly technique, bioprinting has been extensively used in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine to construct hydrogel-based three-dimensional (3D) tissue-like models with prescribed geometry. Here, we introduced a unique direct-write bioprinting strategy to fabricate a bilayer flat tissue in a hydrogel-free approach. A printed retina pigmented epithelium layer (RPE) was applied as living biopaper for positioning a fibroblast layer without using any hydrogel in bioink. We adjusted the number of cells in the inkjet droplets in order to obtain a uniform printed cell layer and demonstrated the formation of a bilayer construct through confocal imaging. Since our printing system introduced low levels of shear stress to the cells, it did not have a negative effect on cell survival, although cell viability was generally lower than that of control group over 1 week post-printing. In conclusion, our novel direct-write bioprinting approach to spatiotemporally position different cellular layers may represent an efficient tool to develop living constructs especially for regeneration of complex flat tissues.

32038993	To date, PDAC remains the cancer having the worst prognosis with mortality rates constantly on the rise. Efficient cures are still absent, despite all attempts to understand the aggressive physiopathology underlying this disease. A major stumbling block is the outdated preclinical modeling strategies applied in assessing effectiveness of novel anticancer therapeutics. Current in vitro preclinical models have a low fidelity to mimic the exact architectural and functional complexity of PDAC tumor found in human set, due to the lack of major components such as immune system and tumor microenvironment with its associated chemical and mechanical signals. The existing PDAC preclinical platforms are still far from being reliable and trustworthy to guarantee the success of a drug in clinical trials. Therefore, there is an urgent demand to innovate novel in vitro preclinical models that mirrors with precision tumor-microenvironment interface, pressure of immune system, and molecular and morphological aspects of the PDAC normally experienced within the living organ. This review outlines the traditional preclinical models of PDAC namely 2D cell lines, genetically engineered mice, and xenografts, and describing the present famous approach of 3D organoids. We offer a detailed narration of the pros and cons of each model system. Finally, we suggest the incorporation of two off-center newly born techniques named 3D bio-printing and organs-on-chip and discuss the potentials of swine models and in silico tools, as powerful new tools able to transform PDAC preclinical modeling to a whole new level and open new gates in personalized medicine.

The exoskeleton assistive device in this study has been designed primarily for hemiplegic stroke patients to aid in the extension of fingers to open up the palm to simulate the effects of rehabilitation. This exoskeleton was designed as an anterior-support type to achieve palmar extension and acts as a robotic assistive device for rehabilitation in bilateral upper limb task training. Testing results show that this wearable exoskeleton assistive device with human factor consideration using percentile dimensions can provide comfortable wear on patients as well as adequate torque to pull individual fingers into flexion towards the palm for rehabilitation.

31941417	Objective. The aim of this study is to present a 3-dimensional (3D)-printed device to simply perform abdominal enterostomy and colostomy. Summary Background Data. Enterostomy and colostomy are frequently performed during abdominal surgery. 3D-printed devices may permit the creation of enterostomy easily. Methods. The device was designed by means of a CAD (computer-aided design) software, Rhinoceros 6 by MC Neel, and manufactured using 3D printers, Factory 2.0 by Omni 3D and Raise 3D N2 Dual Plus by Raise 3D. Colostomy was scheduled on a human cadaver and on 6 Pietrain pigs to test the device and the surgical technique. Results. The test on the cadaver showed that the application of the device was easy. Test on porcine models confirmed that the application of the device was also easy on the living model. The average duration of the surgical procedure was 32 minutes (25-40 minutes). For the female pigs, return to full oral diet and recovery of a normal bowel function was observed at postoperative day 2. The device fell by itself on average on the third day. Until day 10, when euthanasia was practiced, the stoma mucosa had a good coloration indicating a perfect viability of tissues. No complications were observed. Conclusions. This is the first study that describes the use of a 3D-printed device in abdominal surgery. End-type colostomy using a 3D-printed device can be safely and easily performed in an experimental porcine model, without postoperative complications. Further studies are needed to evaluate its utility in the clinical setting.

31881380	Modeling the interaction between the supportive stroma and the hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) is of high interest in the regeneration of the bone marrow niche in blood disorders. In this work, we present an injectable co-culture system to study this interaction in a coherent in vitro culture and in vivo transplantation model. We assemble a 3D hematopoietic niche in vitro by co-culture of supportive OP9 mesenchymal cells and HSPCs in porous, chemically defined collagen-coated carboxymethylcellulose microscaffolds (CCMs). Flow cytometry and hematopoietic colony forming assays demonstrate the stromal supportive capacity for in vitro hematopoiesis in the absence of exogenous cytokines. After in vitro culture, we recover a paste-like living injectable niche biomaterial from CCM co-cultures by controlled, partial dehydration. Cell viability and the association between stroma and HSPCs are maintained in this process. After subcutaneous injection of this living artificial niche in vivo, we find maintenance of stromal and hematopoietic populations over 12 weeks in immunodeficient mice.

31829985	Laser bioprinting is a term that refers to a group of laser-based techniques for printing living cells with high precision and good viability. Most of these techniques are based on modifications of the standard laser induced forward transfer technique (LIFT). When it comes to printing living material, direct laser irradiation should be avoided, therefore an indirect LIFT technique comprising an energy absorption layer should be used. This work presents a blister actuated-LIFT (BA-LIFT) technique which uses a commercial polyimide tape as a uniform energy absorption layer. To increase the potential of the technique for cell selection and printing accuracy, we take advantage of the high optical transmission of the polyimide layer to implement an in-line fluorescence and conventional imaging vision system coaxial with the laser path. With this system and using the appropriate staining methodology it is possible to track and identify different cell types, selecting those to be transferred and tracking cell survival both in the donor and acceptor substrates. We studied the BA-LIFT printability map for sodium alginate and methylcellulose hydrogels in the fluence range from 6.1 to 2.0 J cm-2 together with the cell viability assessment measured by our fluorescence system. The study has revealed that less concentrated, therefore less viscose hydrogel shows better results with lower fluences, whereas hydrogels with higher concentrations present better results at higher fluences. Also, at low fluences 98 % of cell viability was obtained, besides both primary cells and cell lines keep their integrity, proliferating and functional activity. The technique was tested by tracking and targeting mouse hematopoietic progenitor stem cells transferred to assess colony forming units; moreover, natural killer cells were isolated and its activation in a stimulation media was tracked with the fluorescence system.

31822648	Over the years, the field of bioprinting has attracted attention for its highly automated fabrication system that enables the precise patterning of living cells and biomaterials at pre-defined positions for enhanced cell-matrix and cell-cell interactions. Notably, vat polymerization (VP)-based bioprinting is an emerging bioprinting technique for various tissue engineering applications due to its high fabrication accuracy. Particularly, different photo-initiators (PIs) are utilized during the bioprinting process to facilitate the crosslinking mechanism for fabrication of high-resolution complex tissue constructs. The advancements in VP-based printing have led to a paradigm shift in fabrication of tissue constructs from cell-seeding of tissue scaffolds (non-biocompatible fabrication process) to direct bioprinting of cell-laden tissue constructs (biocompatible fabrication process). This paper, presenting a first-time comprehensive review of the VP-based bioprinting process, provides an in-depth analysis and comparison of the various biocompatible PIs and highlights the important considerations and bioprinting requirements. This review paper reports a detailed analysis of its printing process and the influence of light-based curing modality and PIs on living cells. Lastly, this review also highlights the significance of VP-based bioprinting, the regulatory challenges and presents future directions to transform the VP-based printing technology into imperative tools in the field of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. The readers will be informed on the current limitations and achievements of the VP-based bioprinting techniques. Notably, the readers will realize the importance and value of highly-automated platforms for tissue engineering applications and be able to develop objective viewpoints towards this field.

31792444	Materials can be made multifunctional by embedding them with living cells that perform sensing, synthesis, energy production, and physical movement. A challenge is that the conditions needed for living cells are not conducive to materials processing and require continuous water and nutrients. Here, we present a three dimensional (3D) printer that can mix material and cell streams to build 3D objects. Bacillus subtilis spores were printed within the material and germinated on its exterior surface, including spontaneously in new cracks. The material was resilient to extreme stresses, including desiccation, solvents, osmolarity, pH, ultraviolet light, and γ-radiation. Genetic engineering enabled the bacteria to respond to stimuli or produce chemicals on demand. As a demonstration, we printed custom-shaped hydrogels containing bacteria that can sense or kill Staphylococcus aureus, a causative agent of infections. This work demonstrates materials endued with living functions that can be used in applications that require storage or exposure to environmental stresses.

31783385	Recently, decellularized extracellular matrix-based bio-ink (dECM bio-ink) derived from animal organs is attracting attention because of its excellent biocompatibility. However, its poor 3D printability and weak mechanical properties remain a challenge. Here, we developed a new dECM bio-ink with enhanced 3D printability and mechanical properties. dECM micro-particles of about 13.4 μm in size were prepared by decellularizing a porcine liver followed by freeze-milling. The new bio-ink, named as dECM powder-based bio-ink (dECM pBio-ink), was prepared by loading the dECM micro-particles into a gelatin mixture. The usefulness of the dECM pBio-ink was evaluated by assessing its mechanical properties, printability, and cytocompatibility. The results showed that its mechanical properties and 3D printability were greatly improved. Its elastic modulus increased by up to 9.17 times that of the conventional dECM bio-ink. Micro-patterns with living cells were successfully achieved with 93% cell viability. Above all, the new bio-ink showed superior performance in stacking of layers for 3D printing, whereas the conventional bio-ink could not maintain its shape. Finally, we demonstrated that the dECM pBio-ink possessed comparable cytocompatibility with the conventional dECM bio-ink through in vitro tests with endothelial cells and primary mouse hepatocytes.

31763856	"Near-field electrospinning (NFES) was developed to overcome the intrinsic instability of traditional electrospinning processes and to facilitate the controllable deposition of nanofibers under a reduced electric field. This technique offers a straightforward and versatile method for the precision patterning of two-dimensional (2D) nanofibers. However, three-dimensional (3D) stacked structures built by NFES have been limited to either micron-scale sizes or special shapes. Herein, we report on a direct-write 3D NFES technique to construct self-aligned, template-free, 3D stacked nanoarchitectures by simply adding salt to the polymer solution. Numerical simulations suggested that the electric field could be tuned to achieve self-aligned nanofibers by adjusting the conductivity of the polymer solution. This was confirmed experimentally by using poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) solutions containing 0.1-1.0 wt% NaCl. Using 0.1 wt% NaCl, nanowalls with a maximum of 80 layers could be built with a width of 92 ± 3 nm, height of 6.6 ± 0.1 μm, and aspect ratio (height/width) of 72. We demonstrate the 3D printing of nanoskyscrapers with various designs, such as curved ""nanowall arrays"", nano ""jungle gyms,"" and ""nanobridges"". Further, we present an application of the 3D stacked nanofiber arrays by preparing transparent and flexible polydimethylsiloxane films embedded with Ag-sputtered nanowalls as 3D nanoelectrodes. The conductivity of the nanoelectrodes can be precisely tuned by adjusting the number of 3D printed layers, without sacrificing transmittance (98.5%). The current NFES approach provides a simple, reliable route to build 3D stacked nanoarchitectures with high-aspect ratios for potential application in smart materials, energy devices, and biomedical applications."

31762134	Soft matter systems and materials are moving toward adaptive and interactive behavior, which holds outstanding promise to make the next generation of intelligent soft materials systems inspired from the dynamics and behavior of living systems. But what is an adaptive material? What is an interactive material? How should classical responsiveness or smart materials be delineated? At present, the literature lacks a comprehensive discussion on these topics, which is however of profound importance in order to identify landmark advances, keep a correct and noninflating terminology, and most importantly educate young scientists going into this direction. By comparing different levels of complex behavior in biological systems, this Viewpoint strives to give some definition of the various different materials systems characteristics. In particular, the importance of thinking in the direction of training and learning materials, and metabolic or behavioral materials is highlighted, as well as communication and information-processing systems. This Viewpoint aims to also serve as a switchboard to further connect the important fields of systems chemistry, synthetic biology, supramolecular chemistry and nano- and microfabrication/3D printing with advanced soft materials research. A convergence of these disciplines will be at the heart of empowering future adaptive and interactive materials systems with increasingly complex and emergent life-like behavior.

31741226	The aim of this paper is to review the recent evolution of additive manufacturing (AM) within the medical field of preoperative surgical planning. The discussion begins with an overview of the different techniques, pointing out their advantages and disadvantages as well as an in-depth comparison of different characteristics of the printed parts. Then, the state-of-the-art with respect to preoperative surgical planning is presented. On the one hand, different surgical planning prototypes manufactured by several AM technologies are described. On the other hand, materials used for mimicking different living tissues are explored by focusing on the material properties: elastic modulus, hardness, etc. As a result, doctors can practice before performing surgery and thereby reduce the time needed for the operation. The subject of patient education is also introduced. A thorough review of the process that is required to obtain 3D printed surgical planning prototypes, which is based on different stages, is then carried out. Finally, the ethical issues associated with 3D printing in medicine are discussed, along with its future perspectives. Overall, this is important for improving the outcome of the surgery, since doctors will be able to visualize the affected organs and even to practice surgery before performing it.	3D Printing in Medicine for Preoperative Surgical Planning: A Review.	2020	Feb	Tejo-Otero A;Buj-Corral I;Fenollosa-Artés F	3D printing;Additive manufacturing;Bioengineering;Biomaterials;Preoperative;Surgical planning	Humans;Models, Anatomic;Preoperative Care;Printing, Three-Dimensional;Plastic Surgery Procedures	Annals of biomedical engineering	Centre CIM, Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (CIM UPC), Carrer de Llorens i Artigas, 12, 08028, Barcelona, Spain. atejo@cimupc.org.;Departament of Mechanical Engineering, School of Engineering of Barcelona (ETSEIB), Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya, Av.

By contrast, bioprinted living cellular constructs face considerable translational challenges. In this Perspective, we first summarize the most recent developments in 3D bioprinting for clinical applications, with a focus on how 3D-printed cartilage, bone and skin can be designed for individual patients and fabricated using the patient's own cells. We then discuss key translational considerations, such as the need to ensure close integration of the living device with the patient's vascular network, the development of biocompatible bioinks and the challenges in deriving a physiologically relevant number of cells.

31648135	Escalating cases of organ shortage and donor scarcity worldwide are alarming reminders of the need for alternatives to allograft tissues. Within the last three decades, research efforts in the field of regenerative medicine and tissue engineering continue to address the unmet need for artificial tissues and organs for transplant. Work in the field has evolved to create what we consider a new field, Regenerative Engineering, defined as the Convergence of advanced materials science, stem cell science, physics, developmental biology and clinical translation towards the regeneration of complex tissues and organ systems. Included in the regenerative engineering paradigm is advanced manufacturing. Three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting is a promising and innovative biofabrication strategy to precisely position biologics, including living cells and extracellular matrix (ECM) components, in the prescribed 3D hierarchal organization to create artificial multi-cellular tissues/organs. In this review, we outline recent progress in several bioprinting technologies used to engineer scaffolds with requisite mechanical, structural, and biological complexity. We examine the process parameters affecting bioprinting and bioink-biomaterials and review notable studies on bioprinted skin, cardiac, bone, cartilage, liver, lung, neural, and pancreatic tissue. We also focus on other 3D bioprinting application areas including cancer research, drug testing, high-throughput screening (HTS), and organ-on-a-chip models. We also highlight the current challenges associated with the clinical translation of 3D bioprinting and conclude with the future perspective of bioprinting technology.

31476384	Bioprinting technologies have been advancing at the convergence of automation, digitalization, and new tissue engineering (TE) approaches. In situ bioprinting may be favored during certain situations when compared with the conventional in vitro bioprinting when de novo tissues are to be printed directly on the intended anatomical location in the living body. To date, few attempts have been made to fabricate in situ tissues, which can be safely arrested and immobilized while printing in preclinical living models. In this review, we have explained the need and utility for in situ bioprinting with regard to the conventional bioprinting approach. The two main in situ bioprinting approaches, namely, robotic arm and handheld approaches, have been defined and differentiated. The various studies involving in situ fabrication of skin, bone, and cartilage tissues have been elucidated. Finally, we have also discussed the advantages, challenges, and the prospects in the field of in situ bioprinting modalities in line with parallel technological advancements. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: In situ bioprinting may be favored during certain situations when compared with the conventional in vitro bioprinting when tissues are to be fabricated or repaired directly on the intended anatomical location in the living body, using the body as a bioreactor. However, the technology requires a lot more improvement to fabricate complex tissues in situ, which could eventually be possible through the multi-disciplinary innovations in tissue engineering. This review explains the need and utility and current approaches by handheld and robotic modes for in situ bioprinting. The latest studies involving in situ fabrication of skin, bone, and cartilage tissues have been elucidated. The review also covers the background studies, advantages, technical and ethical challenges, and possible suggestions for future improvements.

31471747	Three-dimensional printed liver models have been used for preoperative simulation. Unlike the standard three-dimensional system on a monitor, the three-dimensional printed model can be observed from any angle manually; therefore, surgeons can obtain a clear image directly from the model. We herein report the use of a unique three-dimensional liver model with a soft and transparent liver parenchyma. Through the parenchyma, the surgeons can observe the intrahepatic vessels and perform incisions in the model as a preoperative simulation.

31468094	Bioprinting technology is a strong tool in producing living functional tissues and organs from cells, biomaterial-based bioinks, and growth factors in computer-controlled platform. The aim of this chapter is to present recent progresses in bioprinting of nerve, skin, cardiac, bone, cartilage, skeletal muscle, and other soft tissues and highlight the challenges in these applications. Various composite bioinks with bioactive ceramic-based scaffolds having patient-specific design and controlled micro-architectures were used at clinical and preclinical applications successfully for regeneration of bone. In nerve tissue engineering, bioprinting of alginate- and gelatin-based gel bioinks by extrusion presented a controllable 3D microstructures and showed satisfactory cytocompatibility and axonal regeneration. Bioprinting of cardiac progenitors in biopolymers resulted in limited success, while the use of bioinks from extracellular matrix induced satisfactory results in cardiac regeneration. Osteochondral scaffold bioprinting is challenging due to the complex hierarchical structure and limited chondral regeneration. Therefore, current approaches focused on osteochondral scaffold with vascular network and mimicking hierarchical structures. The applications of bioprinting in other types of tissues were also studied, and results showed significant potentials in regeneration of tissues such as cornea, liver, and urinary bladder.

31339577	Heart failure affects >26 million patients worldwide. Current cardiac devices save lives, but patients suffer complications. Hence, improved devices are needed. Realheart TAH is a novel total artificial heart which has shown promising results in acute pig studies. However, the device design needed to be evaluated in humans. Virtual implantations demonstrated the device fits in two of three patients, but that there was some interference with the left lung. Herein, we used an innovative 3D-printed model with swivelling device components to test the device in human cadavers. Our new method demonstrated how to optimize design to improve the surgical fit.

35549108	DNA mechanosensors offer unique properties for mechano-adaptive and self-reporting materials, such as programmable bond strength and geometrical strain response, tunable fluorescent strain sensing, interfacing to biological systems, and the ability to store mechanical information. However, the facile incorporation of advanced DNA motifs into polymer networks and achieving robustness in application settings remain difficult. Herein, we introduce one-component DNA mechanoprobes that can be easily polymerized into polymer hydrogels and even elastomers to allow strain-induced fluorescence sensing. The all-in-one mechanoprobe contains a DNA hairpin for programmable force sensing, an internal fluorophore-quencher pair as a reporter, and methacrylamide groups on both ends for rapid and facile photopolymerization into networks based on the nontoxic water-soluble monomer methoxy triethylene glycol acrylate (mTEGA). In addition to mechanosensing hydrogels, we utilize the low Tg of p(mTEGA) to develop the first bulk elastomer materials with DNA force sensors, which show high elasticity and stronger mechanofluorescence. The system makes decisive steps forward for DNA-based mechanoprobes by overcoming the classical multicomponent design of such probes, allowing photopolymerization useful for the design of complex objects or even 3D printing and demonstrating that such motifs may even be useful in dry bulk materials.

35549049	"Three-dimensional (3D) printing utilizing controlled polymerization systems is emerging as a powerful approach to fabricate ""living"" objects, which can be further modified with various functionalities. Here, we report photoinduced free radical-promoted cationic reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization under broad wavelengths from ultraviolet (UV) to near-infrared (NIR) light. A commercially available iron catalyst, cyclopentadienyl iron dicarbonyl dimer (Fe2(Cp)2(CO)4), was used as the photocatalyst, and several diphenyliodonium salts were examined as oxidants. Various poly(vinyl ether)s with controlled molecular weights and a narrow dispersity (1.06-1.32) were prepared through this method. Relatively high chain-end fidelity can be observed and has been demonstrated by successful chain-extension experiments. In addition, benefiting from the penetrating ability of NIR light, 3D objects with different thicknesses were achieved by employing stereolithography-based 3D printing techniques. Furthermore, the postfunctionalization of these 3D printed objects with fluorescent monomers provides a facile method to build 3D objects with complex functionality and potential applications in anticounterfeiting materials."

35525763	Bioprinting - printing with incorporated living cells - has earned special attention on tissue engineering approaches, aiming to closer reproduce the 3D microenvironment of the target tissue. However, it raises extra complexity related to the need to use cell-friendly printing conditions that still comply with material printing fidelity. Inspired by the composite nano structural organization of mineralized tissues, this work reports the efficiency of the chemical approach followed to in situ mineralize blue shark skin collagen, at a nano scale level, to ultimately produce stable inks. The influence of initial cellular density was evaluated by assessing three different concentrations (2.5, 5 and 7.5 × 106 cells·ml-1) of human adipose stem cells (hASC), with the higher density of encapsulated cells presenting improved viability in a long culture term. Immunodetection of osteogenic-related markers, like RUNX2 and osteopontin, 21 days after cell culture in basal conditions confirmed the potential of the ink to be applied for osteogenic purposes, which may be associated with the success of the cell-to-ink interaction and the Ca2+ ions released from the co-precipitated hydroxyapatite. A combination of mineralized shark collagen, alginate and hASC is thus proposed as a bioactive bioink with potential properties for regeneration of bone tissue.

35106374	Patterning chemical reactivity with a high spatiotemporal resolution and chemical versatility is critically important for advancing revolutionary emergent technologies, including nanorobotics, bioprinting, and photopharmacology. Current methods are complex and costly, necessitating novel techniques that are easy to use and compatible with a wide range of chemical functionalities. This study reports the development of a digital light processing (DLP) fluorescence microscope that enables the structuring of visible light (465-625 nm) for high-resolution photochemical patterning and simultaneous fluorescence imaging of patterned samples. A range of visible-light-driven photochemical systems, including thiol-ene photoclick reactions, Wolff rearrangements of diazoketones, and photopolymerizations, are shown to be compatible with this system. Patterning the chemical functionality onto microscopic polymer beads and films is accomplished with photographic quality and resolutions as high as 2.1 μm for Wolff rearrangement chemistry and 5 μm for thiol-ene chemistry. Photoactivation of molecules in living cells is demonstrated with single-cell resolution, and microscale 3D printing is achieved using a polymer resin with a 20 μm xy-resolution and a 100 μm z-resolution. Altogether, this work debuts a powerful and easy-to-use platform that will facilitate next-generation nanorobotic, 3D printing, and metamaterial technologies.

35006951	The three-dimensional (3D) printing of cell-containing polymeric hydrogels creates living materials (LMs), offering a platform for developing innovative technologies in areas like biosensors and biomanufacturing. The polymer material properties of cross-linkable F127-bis-urethane methacrylate (F127-BUM) allow reproducible 3D printing and stability in physiological conditions, making it suitable for fabricating LMs. Though F127-BUM-based LMs permit diffusion of solute molecules like glucose and ethanol, it remains unknown whether these are permissible for oxygen, essential for respiration. To determine oxygen permissibility, we quantified dissolved oxygen consumption by the budding yeast-laden F127-BUM-based LMs. Moreover, we obtained data on cell-retaining LMs, which allowed a direct comparison between LMs and suspension cultures. We further developed a highly reliable method to isolate cells from LMs for flow cytometry analysis, cell viability evaluation, and the purification of macromolecules. We found oxygen consumption heavily impaired inside LMs, indicating that yeast metabolism relies primarily on fermentation instead of respiration. Applying this finding to brewing, we observed a higher (3.7%) ethanol production using LMs than the traditional brewing process, indicating improved fermentation. Our study concludes that the present F127-BUM-based LMs are useful for microaerobic processes but developing aerobic bioprocesses will require further research.

35005920	In nature, cells exist in three-dimensional (3D) microenvironments with topography, stiffness, surface chemistry, and biological factors that strongly dictate their phenotype and behavior. The cellular microenvironment is an organized structure or scaffold that, together with the cells that live within it, make up living tissue. To mimic these systems and understand how the different properties of a scaffold, such as adhesion, proliferation, or function, influence cell behavior, we need to be able to fabricate cellular microenvironments with tunable properties. In this work, the nanotopography and functionality of scaffolds for cell culture were modified by coating 3D printed materials (DS3000 and poly(ethylene glycol)diacrylate, PEG-DA) with cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs). This general approach was demonstrated on a variety of structures designed to incorporate macro- and microscale features fabricated using photopolymerization and 3D printing techniques. Atomic force microscopy was used to characterize the CNC coatings and showed the ability to tune their density and in turn the surface nanoroughness from isolated nanoparticles to dense surface coverage. The ability to tune the density of CNCs on 3D printed structures could be leveraged to control the attachment and morphology of prostate cancer cells. It was also possible to introduce functionalization onto the surface of these scaffolds, either by directly coating them with CNCs grafted with the functionality of interest or with a more general approach of functionalizing the CNCs after coating using biotin-streptavidin coupling. The ability to carefully tune the nanostructure and functionalization of different 3D-printable materials is a step forward to creating in vitro scaffolds that mimic the nanoscale features of natural microenvironments, which are key to understanding their impact on cells and developing artificial tissues.

34996017	It is of great significance to reveal the molecular distribution images in biological tissues, which has led to the bloom of mass spectrometry imaging. Unfortunately, its application is encountering the resistance of high technical barriers and equipment cost, as well as the inability to image substances that cannot be desorbed or ionized, or cannot be separated by their mass-to-charge ratios. Herein presented is a complementary and cost-effective method called capillary array electrophoresis (CAE) imaging. To have the information of molecules and their spatial location, a gridding cutter was fabricated to orderly dissect a tissue section into a leakproof array of micro wells enclosed by the grid-blade arrays. After in situ extraction and fluorophore-labeling of analytes, the samples in the wells were directly subjected to CAE-LIF (laser-induced fluorescence), and the molecular distribution images were depicted with the separated peaks. The practicability was demonstrated by CAE imaging of rat brain tissue sections with amino acid neurotransmitters (e.g., glutamine, 4-aminobutyric acid, alanine, glutamic acid and aspartic acid) as targets. The resultant images showed the global differences of molecular distributions, with a spatial resolution of 1000 μm that was presently determined by the well width but ultimately by the bore size of capillary (down to 10-50 μm). CAE imaging can hence be promising for its low cost, low technical barriers and abundant mechanisms to separate the charged and non-charged, chiral and non-chiral substances.

34952773	Anastomosis of the microvessels requires high-level skills and extensive basic training. This study was performed to introduce and evaluate an inexpensive laboratory device as a training aid. Micro-tubes of 0.8 mm inner diameter and 0.5/0.8 mm wall thickness mimicking human vein/artery were printed from a silicon-containing hydrogel using three-dimensional printing technology. The hydrogel components are optimized to render the printed tubes biomechanical features resembling the blood vessels of a living organism. These artificial vessels were connected to a pump for fluid flow, simulating the blood circulation. Forty medical interns were assigned to two equal groups. The 20 interns in group A practiced anastomosis using the training aid for a total of 10 hours over 5 days. The 20 interns in group B practiced anastomosis using the traditional gum pieces and silicone tubes. Then, all interns performed anastomosis on rat carotid arteries, and their performance was scored by a team of five experienced maxillofacial surgeons. The average success score and time required for anastomosis were compared between the two groups. The mean success score of group A was significantly higher than that of group B (0.83 ± 0.12 vs 0.64 ± 0.10, P < 0.001). The mean anastomosis time of group A was significantly shorter than that of group B (10.2 ± 1.1 vs 17.2 ± 1.4 minutes, P < 0.001). This training device for vessel microanastomosis is an inexpensive, practical, and effective tool for use in laboratories and also reduces the use of animals.

34943846	The aim of the work was to design and construct a microscopic stage that enables the observation of biological cells in a magnetic field with a constant magnetic force. Regarding the requirements for biological observations in the magnetic field, construction was based on the standard automatic stage of an optical microscope ZEISS Axio Observer, and the main challenge was to design a set of magnets which were the source of a field in which the magnetic force was constant in the observation zone. Another challenge was to design a magnet arrangement producing a weak magnetic field to manipulate the cells without harming them. The Halbach array of magnets was constructed using permanent cubic neodymium magnets mounted on a 3D printed polymer ring. Four sets of magnets were used, differing in their dimensions, namely, 20, 15, 12, and 10 mm. The polymer rings were designed to resist magnetic forces and to keep their shape undisturbed when working under biological conditions. To check the usability of the constructs, experiments with magnetic microparticles were executed.

34900964	Human lungs are organs with an intricate hierarchical structure and complex composition; lungs also present heterogeneous mechanical properties that impose dynamic stress on different tissue components during the process of breathing. These physiological characteristics combined create a system that is challenging to model in vitro. Many efforts have been dedicated to develop reliable models that afford a better understanding of the structure of the lung and to study cell dynamics, disease evolution, and drug pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics in the lung. This review presents methodologies used to develop lung tissue models, highlighting their advantages and current limitations, focusing on 3D bioprinting as a promising set of technologies that can address current challenges. 3D bioprinting can be used to create 3D structures that are key to bridging the gap between current cell culture methods and living tissues. Thus, 3D bioprinting can produce lung tissue biomimetics that can be used to develop in vitro models and could eventually produce functional tissue for transplantation. Yet, printing functional synthetic tissues that recreate lung structure and function is still beyond the current capabilities of 3D bioprinting technology. Here, the current state of 3D bioprinting is described with a focus on key strategies that can be used to exploit the potential that this technology has to offer. Despite today's limitations, results show that 3D bioprinting has unexplored potential that may be accessible by optimizing bioink composition and looking at the printing process through a holistic and creative lens.	3D Bioprinting Strategies, Challenges, and Opportunities to Model the Lung Tissue Microenvironment and Its Function.	2021		Barreiro Carpio Mabel;Dabaghi Mohammadhossein;Ungureanu Julia;Kolb Martin R;Hirota Jeremy A;Moran-Mirabal Jose Manuel	additive manufacturing;alveolus;assisted bioprinting;bioink;biomaterial ink;biomimetic;extracellular matrix		Frontiers in bioengineering and biotechnology	Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada.;Firestone Institute for Respiratory Health, Division of Respirology, Department of Medicine, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada.;Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada.;Firestone Institute for Respiratory Health, Division of Respirology, Department of Medicine, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada.;Firestone Institute for Respiratory Health, Division of Respirology, Department of Medicine, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada.;School of Biomedical Engineering, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada.;McMaster Immunology Research Centre, Department of Pathology and Molecular Medicine, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada.;Division of Respiratory Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.;Department of Biology, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada.;Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada.;School of Biomedical Engineering, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada.;Centre for Advanced Light Microscopy, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada.

34892277	Wrist rehabilitation exoskeleton can effectively assist wrist recovery from stroke. However, current wrist rehabilitation devices have shortcomings such as heavy weight, uncertain motion trajectory, etc. This paper proposes a wrist rehabilitation robot driven by 3D-printed multi-segment mechanism to realize wrist rehabilitation in three degrees of freedom. We conducted three tests including bearing force, rehabilitation trajectory, range of motion tests. The results prove this exoskeleton can provide enough force and torque, and it can achieve larger range of motion within the same motor displacement, that makes it more compact and lighter in hardware and less expensive in cost. Moreover, its motion trajectory can be controlled and stable, that makes it more applicable for real application in human rehabilitation.Clinical Relevance- Stroke is the leading cause of hemiplegia, and this symptom usually degrades patients' living standard and flexibility.

34875360	3D bioprinting has been developed as an effective and powerful technique for the fabrication of living tissue constructs in a well-controlled manner. However, most existing 3D bioprinting strategies face substantial challenges in replicating delicate and intricate tissue-specific structural organizations using mechanically weak biomaterials such as hydrogels. Embedded bioprinting is an emerging bioprinting strategy that can directly fabricate complex structures derived from soft biomaterials within a supporting matrix, which shows great promise in printing large vascularized tissues and organs. Here, we provide a state-of-the-art review on the development of embedded bioprinting including extrusion-based and light-based processes to manufacture complex tissue constructs with biomimetic architectures. The working principles, bioinks, and supporting matrices of embedded printing processes are introduced. The effect of key processing parameters on the printing resolution, shape fidelity, and biological functions of the printed tissue constructs are discussed. Recent innovations in the processes and applications of embedded bioprinting are highlighted, such as light-based volumetric bioprinting and printing of functional vascularized organ constructs. Challenges and future perspectives with regard to translating embedded bioprinting into an effective strategy for the fabrication of functional biological constructs with biomimetic structural organizations are finally discussed. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: It is still challenging to replicate delicate and intricate tissue-specific structural organizations using mechanically-weak hydrogels for the fabrication of functional living tissue constructs. Embedded bioprinting is an emerging 3D printing strategy that enables to produce complex tissue structures directly inside a reservoir filled with supporting matrix, which largely widens the choice of bioprinting inks to ECM-like hydrogels. Here we aim to provide a comprehensive review on various embedded bioprinting techniques mainly including extrusion-based and light-based processes. Various bioinks, supporting matrices, key processing parameters as well as their effects on the structures and biological functions of resultant living tissue constructs are discussed. We expect that it can provide an important reference and generate new insights for the bioprinting of large vascularized tissues and organs with biological functions.

34864451	The field of cardiac tissue engineering has advanced over the past decades; however, most research progress has been limited to engineered cardiac tissues (ECTs) at the microscale with minimal geometrical complexities such as 3D strips and patches. Although microscale ECTs are advantageous for drug screening applications because of their high-throughput and standardization characteristics, they have limited translational applications in heart repair and the in vitro modeling of cardiac function and diseases. Recently, researchers have made various attempts to construct engineered cardiac pumps (ECPs) such as chambered ventricles, recapitulating the geometrical complexity of the native heart. The transition from microscale ECTs to ECPs at a translatable scale would greatly accelerate their translational applications; however, researchers are confronted with several major hurdles, including geometrical reconstruction, vascularization, and functional maturation. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to review the recent advances on bioengineering approaches for fabrication of functional engineered cardiac pumps. We first review the bioengineering approaches to fabricate ECPs, and then emphasize the unmatched potential of 3D bioprinting techniques. We highlight key advances in bioprinting strategies with high cell density as researchers have begun to realize the critical role that the cell density of non-proliferative cardiomyocytes plays in the cell-cell interaction and functional contracting performance. We summarize the current approaches to engineering vasculatures both at micro- and meso-scales, crucial for the survival of thick cardiac tissues and ECPs. We showcase a variety of strategies developed to enable the functional maturation of cardiac tissues, mimicking the in vivo environment during cardiac development. By highlighting state-of-the-art research, this review offers personal perspectives on future opportunities and trends that may bring us closer to the promise of functional ECPs.

34854551	The field of living materials seeks to harness living cells as microfactories that can construct a material itself or enhance the performance of material in some manner. While recent advances in 3D printing allow microbe manipulation to create bespoke living materials, the effective coupling of these living components in reinforced bioink designs remains a major challenge due to the difficulty in building a robust and cell-friendly microenvironment. Here, a type of dual-network bioink is reported for the 3D printing of living materials with enhanced biocatalysis capabilities, where bioinks are readily printable and provide a biocompatible environment along with desirable mechanical performance. It is demonstrated that integrating microbes into these bioinks enables the direct printing of catalytically living materials with high cell viability and maintains metabolic activity, which those living materials can be preserved and reused. Further, a bacteria-algae coculture system is fabricated for the bioremediation of chemicals, giving rise to its potential field applications.	3D Printed Biocatalytic Living Materials with Dual-Network Reinforced Bioinks.	2022	Feb	He Fukun;Ou Yangteng;Liu Ji;Huang Qiu;Tang Bao;Xin Fengxue;Zhang Jing;Jiang Min;Chen Su;Yu Ziyi	3D printing;bioinks;dual-network;living materials	Biocatalysis;Bioprinting;Printing, Three-Dimensional;Tissue Engineering;Tissue Scaffolds	Small (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)	State Key Laboratory of Materials-Oriented Chemical Engineering, College of Chemical Engineering, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Fine Chemicals and Functional Polymer Materials, Nanjing Tech University, Nanjing, 211816, P.

34832817	Bioprinting offers great potential for the fabrication of three-dimensional living tissues by the precise layer-by-layer printing of biological materials, including living cells and cell-laden hydrogels. The laser-induced forward transfer (LIFT) of cell-laden bioinks is one of the most promising laser-printing technologies enabling biofabrication. However, for it to be a viable bioprinting technology, bioink printability must be carefully examined. In this study, we used a time-resolved imaging system to study the cell-laden bioink droplet formation process in terms of the droplet size, velocity, and traveling distance. For this purpose, the bioinks were prepared using breast cancer cells with different cell concentrations to evaluate the effect of the cell concentration on the droplet formation process and the survival of the cells after printing. These bioinks were compared with cell-free bioinks under the same printing conditions to understand the effect of the particle physical properties on the droplet formation procedure. The morphology of the printed droplets indicated that it is possible to print uniform droplets for a wide range of cell concentrations. Overall, it is concluded that the laser fluence and the distance of the donor-receiver substrates play an important role in the printing impingement type; consequently, a careful adjustment of these parameters can lead to high-quality printing.

34821744	In recent years, tissue engineering has achieved significant advancements towards the repair of damaged tissues. Until this day, the vascularization of engineered tissues remains a challenge to the development of large-scale artificial tissue. Recent breakthroughs in biomaterials and three-dimensional (3D) printing have made it possible to manipulate two or more biomaterials with complementary mechanical and/or biological properties to create hybrid scaffolds that imitate natural tissues. Hydrogels have become essential biomaterials due to their tissue-like physical properties and their ability to include living cells and/or biological molecules. Furthermore, 3D printing, such as dispensing-based bioprinting, has progressed to the point where it can now be utilized to construct hybrid scaffolds with intricate structures. Current bioprinting approaches are still challenged by the need for the necessary biomimetic nano-resolution in combination with bioactive spatiotemporal signals. Moreover, the intricacies of multi-material bioprinting and hydrogel synthesis also pose a challenge to the construction of hybrid scaffolds. This manuscript presents a brief review of scaffold bioprinting to create vascularized tissues, covering the key features of vascular systems, scaffold-based bioprinting methods, and the materials and cell sources used. We will also present examples and discuss current limitations and potential future directions of the technology.

The emerging field of living materials has leveraged microbial engineering to produce materials for various applications but building 3D structures in arbitrary patterns and shapes has been a major challenge.

34806790	Room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) has been extensively researched in heavy-metal containing complexes and purely organic systems. Despite the rapid blossom of RTP materials, it is still a tremendous challenge to develop highly efficient blue RTP materials with long-lived lifetimes. Taking the metal-organic framework (MOF) as a model, herein, a feasible strategy of ligand functionalization is proposed, including two essential elements, to develop blue phosphorescence materials with high efficiency and long-lived lifetimes simultaneously under ambient conditions. One is isolation of the chromophores with assistance of another predefined co-ligands, the other is restriction of the chromophores' motions through coordination and host-guest interactions. Remarkably, it renders the MOFs with highly efficient blue phosphorescence up to 80.6% and a lifetime of 169.7 ms under ambient conditions. Moreover, a demo of the crown is fabricated with MOFs ink by 3D printing technique. The potential applications for anti-counterfeiting and fingerprint visualization have been also demonstrated. This finding not only outlines a universal principle to design and synthesize highly efficient RTP materials, but also endows traditional MOFs with fresh vitality for potential applications.

34702546	The current gold standard for auricular reconstruction after microtia or ear trauma is the autologous cartilage graft with an autologous skin flap overlay. Harvesting autologous cartilage requires an additional surgery that may result in donor area complications. In addition, autologous cartilage is limited and the auricular reconstruction requires complex sculpting, which requires excellent clinical skill and is very time consuming. This work explores the use of 3D printing technology to fabricate bioactive artificial auricular cartilage using chondrocyte-laden gelatin methacrylate (GelMA) and polylactic acid (PLA) for auricle reconstruction. In this study, chondrocytes were loaded within GelMA hydrogel and combined with the 3D-printed PLA scaffolds to biomimetic the biological mechanical properties and personalized shape. The printing accuracy personalized scaffolds, biomechanics and chondrocyte viability and biofunction of artificial auricle have been studied. It was found that chondrocytes were fixed in the PLA auricle scaffolds via GelMA hydrogels and exhibited good proliferative properties and cellular activity. In addition, new chondrocytes and chondrogenic matrix, as well as type II collagen were observed after 8 weeks of implantation. At the same time, the transplanted auricle complex kept full and delicate auricle shape. This study demonstrates the potential of using 3D printing technology to construct in vitro living auricle tissue. It shows a great prospect in the clinical application of auricle regeneration.

34672027	The encapsulation of cells within gel-phase materials to form bioinks offers distinct advantages for next-generation 3D bioprinting. 3D bioprinting has emerged as a promising tool for patterning cells, but the technology remains limited in its ability to produce biofunctional, tissue-like constructs due to a dearth of materials suitable for bioinks. While early demonstrations commonly used viscous polymers optimized for printability, these materials often lacked cell compatibility and biological functionality. In response, advanced materials that exist in the gel phase during the entire printing process are being developed, since hydrogels are uniquely positioned to both protect cells during extrusion and provide biological signals to embedded cells as the construct matures during culture. Here, an overview of the design considerations for gel-phase materials as bioinks is presented, with a focus on their mechanical, biochemical, and dynamic gel properties. Current challenges and opportunities that arise due to the fact that bioprinted constructs are active, living hydrogels composed of both acellular and cellular components are also evaluated. Engineering hydrogels with consideration of cells as an intrinsic component of the printed bioink will enable control over the evolution of the living construct after printing to achieve greater biofunctionality.	3D Bioprinting of Cell-Laden Hydrogels for Improved Biological Functionality.	2022	Jan	Hull Sarah M;Brunel Lucia G;Heilshorn Sarah C	biofabrication;bioink;bioprinting;hydrogel;regenerative medicine;tissue engineering	Bioprinting;Hydrogels;Polymers;Printing, Three-Dimensional;Tissue Engineering	Advanced materials (Deerfield Beach, Fla.)

34664115	Immobilizing microorganisms inside 3D printed semi-permeable substrates can be desirable for biotechnological processes since it simplifies product separation and purification, reducing costs, and processing time. To this end, we developed a strategy for synthesizing a feedstock suitable for 3D bioprinting of mechanically rigid and insoluble materials with embedded living bacteria. The processing route is based on a highly particle-filled alumina/chitosan nanocomposite gel which is reinforced by (a) electrostatic interactions with alginate and (b) covalent binding between the chitosan molecules with the mild gelation agent genipin. To analyze network formation and material properties, we characterized the rheological properties and printability of the feedstock gel. Stability measurements showed that the genipin-crosslinked chitosan/alginate/alumina gels did not dissolve in PBS, NaOH, or HCl after 60 days of incubation. Alginate-containing gels also showed less swelling in water than gels without alginate. Furthermore, E. coli bacteria were embedded in the nanocomposites and we analyzed the influence of the individual bioink components as well as of the printing process on bacterial viability. Here, the addition of alginate was necessary to maintain the effective viability of the embedded bacteria, while samples without alginate showed no bacterial viability. The experimental results demonstrate the potential of this approach for producing macroscopic bioactive materials with complex 3D geometries as a platform for novel applications in bioprocessing.

34652130	Biofilms are three-dimensional (3D) bacterial communities that exhibit a highly self-organized nature in terms of their composition and complex architecture. Bacteria in biofilms display emergent biological properties, such as resistance to antimicrobials and disinfectants that the individual planktonic cells lack. Bacterial biofilms possess specialized architectural features including unique extracellular matrix compositions and a distinct spatially patterned arrangement of cells and matrix components within the biofilm. It is unclear which of these architectural elements of bacterial biofilms lead to the development of their emergent biological properties. Here, we report a 3D printing-based technique for studying the emergent resistance behaviors of Escherichia coli biofilms as a function of their architecture. Cellulose and curli are the major extracellular-matrix components in E. coli biofilms. We show that 3D-printed biofilms expressing either curli alone or both curli and cellulose in their extracellular matrices show higher resistance to exposure against disinfectants than 3D prints expressing either cellulose alone or no biofilm-matrix components. The 3D-printed biofilms expressing cellulose and/or curli also show thicker anaerobic zones than nonbiofilm-forming E. coli 3D prints. Thus, the matrix composition plays a crucial role in the emergent spatial patterning and biological endurance of 3D-printed biofilms. In contrast, initial spatial distribution of bacterial density or curli-producing cells does not have an effect on biofilm resistance phenotypes. Further, these 3D-printed biofilms could be reversibly attached to different surfaces (bacterial cellulose, glass, and polystyrene) and display resistance to physical distortions by retaining their shape and structure. This physical robustness highlights their potential in applications including bioremediation, protective coatings against pathogens on medical devices, or wastewater treatment, among many others. This new understanding of the emergent behavior of bacterial biofilms could aid in the development of novel engineered living materials using synthetic biology and materials science approaches.

34650164	In this study, the effects of surface roughness and pore characteristics on fatigue lives of laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) Ti-6Al-4V parts were investigated. The 197 fatigue bars were printed using the same laser power but with varied scanning speeds. These actions led to variations in the geometries of microscale pores, and such variations were characterized using micro-computed tomography. To generate differences in surface roughness in fatigue bars, half of the samples were grit-blasted and the other half were machined. Fatigue behaviors were analyzed with respect to surface roughness and statistics of the pores. For the grit-blasted samples, the contour laser scan in the LPBF strategy led to a pore-depletion zone isolating surface and internal pores with different features. For the machined samples, where surface pores resemble internal pores, the fatigue life was highly correlated with the average pore size and projected pore area in the plane perpendicular to the stress direction. Finally, a machine learning model using a drop-out neural network (DONN) was employed to establish a link between surface and pore features to the fatigue data (logN), and good prediction accuracy was demonstrated. Besides predicting fatigue lives, the DONN can also estimate the prediction uncertainty.

34617338	Solid-state optics has been the pillar of modern digital age. Integrating soft hydrogel materials with micro/nanooptics could expand the horizons of photonics for bioengineering. Here, wet-spun multilayer hydrogel fibers are engineered through ionic-crosslinked natural polysaccharides that serve as multifunctional platforms. The resulting flexible hydrogel structure and reversible crosslinking provide tunable design properties such as adjustable refractive index and fusion splicing. Modulation of the optical readout via physical stimuli, including shape, compression, and multiple optical inputs/outputs is demonstrated. The unique permeability of the hydrogels is also combined with plasmonic nanoparticles for molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 in fiber-coupled biomedical swabs. A tricoaxial 3D printing nozzle is then employed for the continuous fabrication of living optical fibers. Light interaction with living cells enables the quantification and digitalization of complex biological phenomena such as 3D cancer progression and drug susceptibility.

Three-dimensional printing technology represents one of the most significant advances in the field of cardiac imaging, interventional cardiology or cardiovascular surgery. Patient-specific models may provide substantial information on intervention planning in complex cardiovascular diseases, and volumetric medical imaging from CT or MRI can be translated into patient-specific 3D models using advanced post-processing applications. 3D printing and additive manufacturing have a great variety of clinical applications targeting anatomy, implants and devices, assisting optimal interventional treatment and post-interventional evaluation. Although the 3D printing technology still lacks scientific evidence, its benefits have been shown in structural heart diseases as well as for treatment of complex arrhythmias and corrective surgery interventions. Recent development has enabled transformation of conventional 3D printing into complex 3D functional living tissues contributing to regenerative medicine through engineered bionic materials such hydrogels, cell suspensions or matrix components. This review aims to present the most recent clinical applications of 3D printing in cardiovascular medicine, highlighting also the potential for future development of this revolutionary technology in the medical field.	3D Printing-A Cutting Edge Technology for Treating Post-Infarction Patients.	2021	Sep	Cernica Daniel;Benedek Imre;Polexa Stefania;Tolescu Cosmin;Benedek Theodora	3D printing;additive manufacturing;anatomic model;interventional cardiology;regenerative cardiology		Life (Basel, Switzerland)	"Center of Advanced Research in Multimodal Cardiovascular Imaging, Cardio Med Medical Center, 540124 Targu Mures, Romania.;Cardiology Department, University of Medicine, Pharmacy, Sciences and Technologies ""George Emil Palade"", 540142 Targu Mures, Romania.;Center of Advanced Research in Multimodal Cardiovascular Imaging, Cardio Med Medical Center, 540124 Targu Mures, Romania.;Cardiology Department, University of Medicine, Pharmacy, Sciences and Technologies ""George Emil Palade"", 540142 Targu Mures, Romania.;Center of Advanced Research in Multimodal Cardiovascular Imaging, Cardio Med Medical Center, 540124 Targu Mures, Romania.;Cardiology Department, University of Medicine, Pharmacy, Sciences and Technologies ""George Emil Palade"", 540142 Targu Mures, Romania.;Center of Advanced Research in Multimodal Cardiovascular Imaging, Cardio Med Medical Center, 540124 Targu Mures, Romania.;Cardiology Department, University of Medicine, Pharmacy, Sciences and Technologies ""George Emil Palade"", 540142 Targu Mures, Romania.;Center of Advanced Research in Multimodal Cardiovascular Imaging, Cardio Med Medical Center, 540124 Targu Mures, Romania.;Cardiology Department, University of Medicine, Pharmacy, Sciences and Technologies ""George Emil Palade"", 540142 Targu Mures, Romania."

34569682	The ability to print soft materials into predefined architectures with programmable nanostructures and mechanical properties is a necessary requirement for creating synthetic biomaterials that mimic living tissues. However, the low viscosity of common materials and lack of required mechanical properties in the final product present an obstacle to the use of traditional additive manufacturing approaches. Here, a new liquid-in-liquid 3D printing approach is used to successfully fabricate constructs with internal nanostructures using in situ self-assembly during the extrusion of an aqueous solution containing surfactant and photocurable polymer into a stabilizing polar oil bath. Subsequent photopolymerization preserves the nanostructures created due to surfactant self-assembly at the immiscible liquid-liquid interface, which is confirmed by small-angle X-ray scattering. Mechanical properties of the photopolymerized prints are shown to be tunable based on constituent components of the aqueous solution. The reported 3D printing approach expands the range of low-viscosity materials that can be used in 3D printing, and enables robust constructs production with internal nanostructures and spatially defined features. The reported approach has broad applications in regenerative medicine by providing a platform to print self-assembling biomaterials into complex tissue mimics where internal supramolecular structures and their functionality control biological processes, similar to natural extracellular matrices.

34559943	There is a need for long-lived hepatic in vitro models to better predict drug induced liver injury (DILI). Human liver-derived epithelial organoids are a promising cell source for advanced in vitro models. Here, organoid technology is combined with biofabrication techniques, which holds great potential for the design of in vitro models with complex and customizable architectures. Here, porous constructs with human hepatocyte-like cells derived from organoids are generated using extrusion-based printing technology. Cell viability of bioprinted organoids remains stable for up to ten days (88-107% cell viability compared to the day of printing). The expression of hepatic markers, transporters, and phase I enzymes increased compared to undifferentiated controls, and is comparable to non-printed controls. Exposure to acetaminophen, a well-known hepatotoxic compound, decreases cell viability of bioprinted liver organoids to 21-51% (p < 0.05) compared to the start of exposure, and elevated levels of damage marker miR-122 are observed in the culture medium, indicating the potential use of the bioprinted constructs for toxicity testing. In conclusion, human liver-derived epithelial organoids can be combined with a biofabrication approach, thereby paving the way to create perfusable, complex constructs which can be used as toxicology- and disease-models.

34552987	Three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting is a revolutionary technology that replicates 3D functional living tissue scaffolds in vitro by controlling the layer-by-layer deposition of biomaterials and enables highly precise positioning of cells. With the development of this technology, more advanced research on the mechanisms of tissue morphogenesis, clinical drug screening, and organ regeneration may be pursued. Because of their self-renewal characteristics and multidirectional differentiation potential, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have outstanding advantages in stem cell research and applications. In this review, we discuss the advantages of different bioinks containing human iPSCs that are fabricated by using 3D bioprinting. In particular, we focus on the ability of these bioinks to support iPSCs and promote their proliferation and differentiation. In addition, we summarize the applications of 3D bioprinting with iPSC-containing bioinks and put forward new views on the current research status.

34544668	In recent years, the development of digital imaging technology has had a significant influence in liver surgery. The ability to obtain a 3-dimensional (3D) visualization of the liver anatomy has provided surgery with virtual reality of simulation 3D computer models, 3D printing models and more recently holograms and augmented reality (when virtual reality knowledge is superimposed onto reality). In addition, the utilization of real-time fluorescent imaging techniques based on indocyanine green (ICG) uptake allows clinicians to precisely delineate the liver anatomy and/or tumors within the parenchyma, applying the knowledge obtained preoperatively through digital imaging. The combination of both has transformed the abstract thinking until now based on 2D imaging into a 3D preoperative conception (virtual reality), enhanced with real-time visualization of the fluorescent liver structures, effectively facilitating intraoperative navigated liver surgery (augmented reality).

34534709	Tissue engineering approaches for bone repair have rapidly evolved due to the development of novel biofabrication technologies, providing an opportunity to fabricate anatomically-accurate living implants with precise placement of specific cell types. However, limited availability of biomaterial inks, that can be 3D-printed with high resolution, while providing high structural support and the potential to direct cell differentiation and maturation towards the osteogenic phenotype, remains an ongoing challenge. Aiming towards a multifunctional biomaterial ink with high physical stability and biological functionality, this work describes the development of a nanocomposite biomaterial ink (Mg-PCL) comprising of magnesium hydroxide nanoparticles (Mg) and polycaprolactone (PCL) thermoplastic for 3D printing of strong and bioactive bone regenerative scaffolds. We characterised the Mg nanoparticle system and systematically investigated the cytotoxic and osteogenic effects of Mg supplementation to human mesenchymal stromal cells (hMSCs) 2D-cultures. Next, we prepared Mg-PCL biomaterial ink using a solvent casting method, and studied the effect of Mg over mechanical properties, printability and scaffold degradation. Furthermore, we delivered MSCs within Mg-PCL scaffolds using a gelatin-methacryloyl (GelMA) matrix, and evaluated the effect of Mg over cell viability and osteogenic differentiation. Nanocomposite Mg-PCL could be printed with high fidelity at 20 wt% of Mg content, and generated a mechanical reinforcement between 30%-400% depending on the construct internal geometry. We show that Mg-PCL degrades faster than standard PCL in an accelerated-degradation assay, which has positive implications towards in vivo implant degradation and bone regeneration. Mg-PCL did not affect MSCs viability, but enhanced osteogenic differentiation and bone-specific matrix deposition, as demonstrated by higher ALP/DNA levels and Alizarin Red calcium staining. Finally, we present proof of concept of Mg-PCL being utilised in combination with a bone-specific bioink (Sr-GelMA) in a coordinated-extrusion bioprinting strategy for fabrication of hybrid constructs with high stability and synergistic biological functionality. Mg-PCL further enhanced the osteogenic differentiation of encapsulated MSCs and supported bone ECM deposition within the bioink component of the hybrid construct, evidenced by mineralised nodule formation, osteocalcin (OCN) and collagen type-I (Col I) expression within the bioink filaments. This study demonstrated that magnesium-based nanocomposite bioink material optimised for extrusion-based 3D printing of bone regenerative scaffolds provide enhanced mechanical stability and bone-related bioactivity with promising potential for skeletal tissue regeneration.

34513372	The importance and complexity of cerebral bypass surgery (CBS) highlight the necessity for intense and dedicated training. Several available training models are yet to satisfy this need. In this technical note, we share the steps to construct a digital imaging and communications in medicine (DICOM)-based middle cerebral artery (MCA) model that is anatomically accurate, resembles handling properties of living tissue, and enables trainers to observe the cerebrovascular anatomy, improve and maintain microsurgical dexterity, and train in the essential steps of CBS. The internal and external molds were created from the geometry of DICOM-based MCA using Fusion 360 software (Autodesk, San Rafael, USA). They were then three-dimension (3D) printed using a polylactic acid filament. The 15% w/v solution of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) was prepared and injected between the molds. Using five freeze-thaw cycles the solution was converted to tissue-mimicking cryo-gel. The model was then placed in a chloroform bath until the internal mold dissolved. To evaluate the accuracy of the MCA model, selected characteristics were measured and compared with the MCA mesh. The DICOM-based MCA model was produced using 3D printing that was available in the lab and the overall cost was less than $5 per model. The external mold required six and a half hours to be 3D printed, while the internal mold only required 23 minutes. Overall, the time required to 3D print the DICOM-based MCA model was just short of seven hours. The greatest statistically significant difference between the virtual MCA model and the DICOM-based MCA model was found in the length of the pre-bifurcation part of the M1 segment and the total length of the superior bifurcation trunk of M1 and superior branch of M2. The smallest statistically significant difference was found at the diameter of the inferior post-bifurcation trunk of the M1 segment and the diameter at the origin of the artery. This technical report aims to show the construction of a CBS training system involving the DICOM-based MCA model that demonstrates the shape of the vascular tree, resembles the handling/suturing properties of living tissue, and helps set up a homemade training station. We believe that our DICOM-based MCA model can serve as a valuable resource for CBS training throughout the world due to its cost-effectiveness and straightforward construction steps. Moreover, once the DICOM-based MCA model is used with our training station, it may offer an option for trainers to gain and maintain CBS skills despite limitations on time, cost, and space.

34512229	Nanotechnology has provided tools for next generation biomedical devices which rely on nanostructure interfaces with living cells. In vitro biomimetic structures have enabled observation of cell response to various mechanical and chemical cues, and there is a growing interest in isolating and harnessing the specific cues that three-dimensional microenvironments can provide without the requirement for such culture and the experimental drawbacks associated with it. Here we report a randomly oriented gold coated Si nanowire substrate with patterned hydrophobic-hydrophilic areas for differentiation of isogenic breast cancer cells of varying metastatic potential. When considering synthetic surfaces for the study of cell-nanotopography interfaces, randomly oriented nanowires more closely resemble the isotropic architecture of natural extracellular matrix as compared to currently more widely used vertical nanowire arrays. In the study reported here, we show that primary cancer cells preferably attach to the hydrophilic region of randomly oriented nanowire substrate while secondary cancer cells do not adhere. Using machine learning analysis of fluorescence images, cells were found to spread and elongate on the nanowire substrates as compared to a flat substrate, where they mostly remain round, when neither surface was coated with extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. Such platforms can not only be used for developing bioassays but also as stepping stones for tissue printing technologies where cells can be selectively patterned at desired locations.

34501164	Traditional rehabilitation systems are evolving into advanced systems that enhance and improve rehabilitation techniques and physical exercise. The reliable assessment and robotic support of the upper limb joints provided by the presented elbow exoskeleton are important clinical goals in early rehabilitation after stroke and other neurological disorders. This allows for not only the support of activities of daily living, but also prevention of the progression neuromuscular pathology through proactive physiotherapy toward functional recovery. The prices of plastics are rising very quickly, as is their consumption, so it makes sense to optimize three dimensional (3D) printing procedures through, for example, improved artificial intelligence-based (AI-based) design or injection simulation, which reduces the use of filament, saves material, reduces waste, and reduces environmental impact. The time and cost savings will not reduce the high quality of the products and can provide a competitive advantage, especially in the case of thinly designed mass products. AI-based optimization allows for one free print after every 6.67 prints (i.e., from materials that were previously wasted).

34449625	Three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting is an emerging fabrication technique to create 3D constructs with living cells. Notably, bioprinting bioinks are limited due to the mechanical weakness of natural biomaterials and the low bioactivity of synthetic peers. This paper presents the development of a natural bioink from chicken eggwhite and sodium alginate for bioprinting cell-laden patches to be used in endothelialized tissue engineering applications. Eggwhite was utilized for enhanced biological properties, while sodium alginate was used to improve bioink printability. The rheological properties of bioinks with varying amounts of sodium alginate were examined with the results illustrating that 2.0-3.0% (w/v) sodium alginate was suitable for printing patch constructs. The printed patches were then characterized mechanically and biologically, and the results showed that the printed patches exhibited elastic moduli close to that of natural heart tissue (20-27 kPa) and more than 94% of the vascular endothelial cells survived in the examination period of one week post 3D bioprinting.

34442615	SlipChips are two-part microfluidic devices that can be reconfigured to change fluidic pathways for a wide range of functions, including tissue stimulation. Currently, fabrication of these devices at the prototype stage requires a skilled microfluidic technician, e.g., for wet etching or alignment steps. In most cases, SlipChip functionality requires an optically clear, smooth, and flat surface that is fluorophilic and hydrophobic. Here, we tested digital light processing (DLP) 3D printing, which is rapid, reproducible, and easily shared, as a solution for fabrication of SlipChips at the prototype stage. As a case study, we sought to fabricate a SlipChip intended for local delivery to live tissue slices through a movable microfluidic port. The device was comprised of two multi-layer components: an enclosed channel with a delivery port and a culture chamber for tissue slices with a permeable support. Once the design was optimized, we demonstrated its function by locally delivering a chemical probe to slices of hydrogel and to living tissue with up to 120 µm spatial resolution. By establishing the design principles for 3D printing of SlipChip devices, this work will enhance the ability to rapidly prototype such devices at mid-scale levels of production.

34377431	Tissue engineering is an evolving multi-disciplinary field with cutting-edge technologies and innovative scientific perceptions that promise functional regeneration of damaged tissues/organs. Tissue engineered medical products (TEMPs) are biomaterial-cell products or a cell-drug combination which is injected, implanted or topically applied in the course of a therapeutic or diagnostic procedure. Current tissue engineering strategies aim at 3D printing/bioprinting that uses cells and polymers to construct living tissues/organs in a layer-by-layer fashion with high 3D precision. However, unlike conventional drugs or therapeutics, TEMPs and 3D bioprinted tissues are novel therapeutics and need different regulatory protocols for clinical trials and commercialization processes. Therefore, it is essential to understand the complexity of raw materials, cellular components, and manufacturing procedures to establish standards that can help to translate these products from bench to bedside. These complexities are reflected in the regulations and standards that are globally in practice to prevent any compromise or undue risks to patients. This review comprehensively describes the current legislations, standards for TEMPs with a special emphasis on 3D bioprinted tissues. Based on these overviews, challenges in the clinical translation of TEMPs & 3D bioprinted tissues/organs along with their ethical concerns and future perspectives are discussed.

34348252	3D bioprinting technology displays many advantages for tissue engineering applications, but its utilization is limited by veryfew bioinks available for biofabrication. In this study, a novel type of bioink, which includes three methacryloyl modifiedmannans, was introduced to 3D bioprinting for tissue engineering applications. Yeast mannan (YM) was modified by reactingwith methacrylate anhydride (MA) at different concentrations, and three YM derived bioinks were obtained, which weretermed as YM-MA-1, YM-MA-2 and YM-MA-3 and were distinguished with different adjusted methacrylation degrees. TheYM derived bioink displayed an advantage that the mechanical properties of its photo-cured hydrogels can be enhanced withits methacrylation degree. Hence, YM derived bioinks are fitted for the mechanical requirements of most soft tissueengineering, including cartilage tissue engineering. By selecting chondrocytes as the testing cells, well cytocompatibility of YM-MA-1, YM-MA-2 had been confirmed by CCK-8 method. Following photo-crosslinking and implantation into SD rats for 4 weeks, thein vivobiocompatibility of the YM-MA-2 hydrogel is acceptable for tissue engineering applications. Hence, YM-MA-2 was chosen for 3D bioprinting. Our data demonstrated that hydrogel products with designed shape and living chondrocytes have been printed by applying YM-MA-2 as the bioink carrying chondrocytes. After the YM-MA-2 hydrogel with encapsulated chondrocytes was implanted subcutaneously in nude mice for 2 weeks, GAG and COLII secretion was confirmed by histological staining in YM-MA-2-H, indicating that the YM derived bioink can be potentially applied to tissue engineering by employing a 3D printer of stereolithography.

34347941	Compartmentalized reaction networks regulating signal processing, communication and pattern formation are central to living systems. Towards achieving life-like materials, we compartmentalized urea-urease and more complex urea-urease/ester-esterase pH-feedback reaction networks into hydrogel spheres and investigate how fuel-driven pH fronts can be sent out from these spheres and regulated by internal reaction networks. Membrane characteristics are installed by covering urease spheres with responsive hydrogel shells. We then encapsulate the two networks (urea-urease and ester-esterase) separately into different hydrogel spheres to devise communication, pattern formation and attraction. Moreover, these pH fronts and patterns can be used for self-growing hydrogels, and for developing complex geometries from non-injectable hydrogels without 3D printing tools. This study opens possibilities for compartmentalized feedback reactions and their use in next generation materials fabrication.

34346622	Five years ago in this journal we described our research into 3D bioprinting of ear cartilage for the purpose of making personalized cartilage implants for facial reconstruction. 3D bioprinting makes it possible to place living cells in a biodegradable scaffold to give a 3D structure to the tissue. We are able to develop a hybrid auricular cartilage implant model. However, Long term in vivo experiments are needed to test preclinical applicability. Nevertheless, the work presented in our studies provides a potential strategy for the use of biofabricated tissue constructs in the clinic. In short, 3D bioprinting is still in its infancy and has no direct clinical application yet. Before the step to the clinic can be made, the technique still has to go through a preclinical phase in which it is investigated how the 3D printed tissue would appear in vivo.

34310082	3D bioprinting is an emerging additive manufacturing technique to fabricate constructs for human disease modeling. However, current cell-laden bioinks lack sufficient biocompatibility, printability, and structural stability needed to translate this technology to preclinical and clinical trials. Here, a new class of nanoengineered hydrogel-based cell-laden bioinks is introduced, that can be printed into 3D, anatomically accurate, multicellular blood vessels to recapitulate both the physical and chemical microenvironments of native human vasculature. A remarkably unique characteristic of this bioink is that regardless of cell density, it demonstrates a high printability and ability to protect encapsulated cells against high shear forces in the bioprinting process. 3D bioprinted cells maintain a healthy phenotype and remain viable for nearly one-month post-fabrication. Leveraging these properties, the nanoengineered bioink is printed into 3D cylindrical blood vessels, consisting of living co-culture of endothelial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells, providing the opportunity to model vascular function and pathophysiology. Upon cytokine stimulation and blood perfusion, this 3D bioprinted vessel is able to recapitulate thromboinflammatory responses observed only in advanced in vitro preclinical models or in vivo. Therefore, this 3D bioprinted vessel provides a potential tool to understand vascular disease pathophysiology and assess therapeutics, toxins, or other chemicals.	3D Bioprinted Multicellular Vascular Models.	2021	Nov	Gold Karli A;Saha Biswajit;Rajeeva Pandian Navaneeth Krishna;Walther Brandon K;Palma Jorge A;Jo Javier;Cooke John P;Jain Abhishek;Gaharwar Akhilesh K	3D bioprinting;cell-laden bioink;disease models;regenerative medicine;vascular tissue	Bioprinting;Endothelial Cells;Humans;Printing, Three-Dimensional;Tissue Engineering;Tissue Scaffolds	Advanced healthcare materials	Biomedical Engineering, College of Engineering, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, 77843, USA.;Biomedical Engineering, College of Engineering, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, 77843, USA.;Biomedical Engineering, College of Engineering, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, 77843, USA.;Biomedical Engineering, College of Engineering, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, 77843, USA.;Department of Cardiovascular Sciences, Houston Methodist Research Institute, Houston Methodist Hospital, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.;Biomedical Engineering, College of Engineering, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, 77843, USA.;Electrical and Computer Engineering, College of Engineering, The University of Oklahoma, Norman, OK, 73019, USA.;Department of Cardiovascular Sciences, Houston Methodist Research Institute, Houston Methodist Hospital, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.;Biomedical Engineering, College of Engineering, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, 77843, USA.;Department of Cardiovascular Sciences, Houston Methodist Research Institute, Houston Methodist Hospital, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.;Medical Physiology, College of Medicine, Texas A&M Health Science Center, Bryan, TX, 77807, USA.;Biomedical Engineering, College of Engineering, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, 77843, USA.;Interdisciplinary Program in Genetics, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, 77843, USA.;Material Science and Engineering, College of Engineering, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, 77843, USA.;Center for Remote Health Technologies and Systems, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, 77843, USA.

34303502	There is a high demand for small diameter vascular grafts having mechanical and biological properties similar to that of living tissues. Tissue-engineered vascular grafts using current methods have often failed due to the mismatch of mechanical properties between the implanted graft and living tissues. To address this limitation, a hybrid bioprinting-electrospinning system is developed for vascular tissue engineering applications. The setup is capable of producing layered structure from electrospun fibres and cell-laden hydrogel. A Creality3D Ender 3D printer has been modified into a hybrid setup having one bioprinting head and two electrospinning heads. Fortus 250mc and Flashforge Creator Pro 3D printers were used to print parts using acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and polylactic acid (PLA) polymers. An Arduino mega 2560 and a Ramps 1.4 controller board were selected to control the functions of the hybrid bioprinting setup.

34303496	Gait analysis provides an important tool for the study and clinical evaluation of conditions which affect knee joint biomechanics. Collection of knee joint kinematics in real world environments during locomotor activities of daily living could provide quantitative evidence to help understand functional impairment. Unfortunately, the high cost and necessary technical expertise associated with current commercially available systems for kinematic monitoring serve as an impediment to their adoption outside of specialized research groups. We have developed a low-cost, custom wearable device to address these shortcomings. The 3D printed device is capable of measuring knee flexion/extension (F/E) and adduction/abduction (AD/AB) angles. Here, we present a gold standard validation of the novel device against an optoelectronic motion capture system (MCS). Data were collected during a treadmill walking task from 8 participants on 2 separate occasions. Agreement with the MCS was quantified via root mean squared error (RMSE), coefficients of multiple correlation (CMC), paired dependent t-tests and Bland-Altman analyses. The wearable device had an overall RMSE of 3.0° and 2.7° and a CMC of 0.97 and 0.91 in F/E and AD/AB respectively. Wearable device error showed no significant differences between test occasions, and Bland-Altman analyses showed low bias with narrow limits of agreement. These results demonstrate the capability of the device to accurately and reliably monitor knee F/E and AD/AB angles showing strong potential for field implementation.

34286149	Recapitulating the vascular networks that maintain the delivery of nutrition, oxygen, and byproducts for the living cells within the three-dimensional (3D) tissue constructs is a challenging issue in the tissue-engineering area. Here, a novel coaxial electrohydrodynamic (EHD) bioprinting strategy is presented to fabricate thick pre-vascularized cell-laden constructs. The alginate and collagen/calcium chloride solution were utilized as the outer-layer and inner-layer bioink, respectively, in the coaxial printing nozzle to produce the core-sheath hydrogel filaments. The effect of process parameters (the feeding rate of alginate and collagen and the moving speed of the printing stage) on the size of core and sheath lines within the printed filaments was investigated. The core-sheath filaments were printed in the predefined pattern to fabricate lattice hydrogel with perfusable lumen structures. Endothelialized lumen structures were fabricated by culturing the core-sheath filaments with endothelial cells laden in the core collagen hydrogel. Multilayer core-sheath filaments were successfully printed into 3D porous hydrogel constructs with a thickness of more than 3 mm. Finally, 3D pre-vascularized cardiac constructs were successfully generated, indicating the efficacy of our strategy to engineer living tissues with complex vascular structures.

34278623	"The diverse morphing behaviors of living creatures arise from their unlimited pathways. In contrast, the equilibrium-driven morphing pathways of common synthetic shape-shifting materials are very limited. For a shape-memory polymer (SMP), its recovery from the temporary shape(s) to the permanent shape typically requires external stimulation and follows a single fixed route. Herein, a covalently crosslinked SMP is designed with ample ureidopyrimidinone (UPy) supramolecular moieties in the network. The UPy units endow the SMP with strong time-temperature dependency, which is explored as a mechanism for spatio-temporal programming of autonomous shape-shifting pathways. In particular, the use of digitally controlled photothermal heating provides versatility in control via an off-equilibrium mechanism. In addition, cooling/heating across its glass transition introduces a locking/unlocking mechanism for its temporal morphing.

34211272	Recent developments in three-dimensional (3D) printing technology offer immense potential in fabricating scaffolds and implants for various biomedical applications, especially for bone repair and regeneration. As the availability of autologous bone sources and commercial products is limited and surgical methods do not help in complete regeneration, it is necessary to develop alternative approaches for repairing large segmental bone defects. The 3D printing technology can effectively integrate different types of living cells within a 3D construct made up of conventional micro- or nanoscale biomaterials to create an artificial bone graft capable of regenerating the damaged tissues. This article reviews the developments and applications of 3D printing in bone tissue engineering and highlights the numerous conventional biomaterials and nanomaterials that have been used in the production of 3D-printed scaffolds. A comprehensive overview of the 3D printing methods such as stereolithography (SLA), selective laser sintering (SLS), fused deposition modeling (FDM), and ink-jet 3D printing, and their technical and clinical applications in bone repair and regeneration has been provided.

34205821	Utilization of advanced engineering thermoplastic materials in fused filament fabrication (FFF) 3D printing process is critical in expanding additive manufacturing (AM) applications. Polypropylene (PP) is a widely used thermoplastic material, while silicon dioxide (SiO2) nanoparticles (NPs), which can be found in many living organisms, are commonly employed as fillers in polymers to improve their mechanical properties and processability. In this work, PP/SiO2 nanocomposite filaments at various concentrations were developed following a melt mixing extrusion process, and used for FFF 3D printing of specimens' characterization according to international standards. Tensile, flexural, impact, microhardness, and dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) tests were conducted to determine the effect of the nanofiller loading on the mechanical and viscoelastic properties of the polymer matrix. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Raman spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy (AFM) were performed for microstructural analysis, and finally melt flow index (MFI) tests were conducted to assess the melt rheological properties. An improvement in the mechanical performance was observed for silica loading up to 2.0 wt.%, while 4.0 wt.% was a potential threshold revealing processability challenges. Overall, PP/SiO2 nanocomposites could be ideal candidates for advanced 3D printing engineering applications towards structural plastic components with enhanced mechanical performance.

34202765	Extrusion bioprinting is considered promising in cartilage tissue engineering since it allows the fabrication of complex, customized, and living constructs potentially suitable for clinical applications. However, clinical translation is often complicated by the variability and unknown/unsolved issues related to this technology. The aim of this study was to perform a risk analysis on a research process, consisting in the bioprinting of a stem cell-laden collagen bioink to fabricate constructs with cartilage-like properties. The method utilized was the Failure Mode and Effect Analysis/Failure Mode and Effect Criticality Analysis (FMEA/FMECA) which foresees a mapping of the process to proactively identify related risks and the mitigation actions. This proactive risk analysis allowed the identification of forty-seven possible failure modes, deriving from seventy-one potential causes. Twenty-four failure modes displayed a high-risk level according to the selected evaluation criteria and threshold (RPN > 100). The results highlighted that the main process risks are a relatively low fidelity of the fabricated structures, unsuitable parameters/material properties, the death of encapsulated cells due to the shear stress generated along the nozzle by mechanical extrusion, and possible biological contamination phenomena. The main mitigation actions involved personnel training and the implementation of dedicated procedures, system calibration, printing conditions check, and, most importantly, a thorough knowledge of selected biomaterial and cell properties that could be built either through the provided data/scientific literature or their preliminary assessment through dedicated experimental optimization phase. To conclude, highlighting issues in the early research phase and putting in place all the required actions to mitigate risks will make easier to develop a standardized process to be quickly translated to clinical use.

34194019	The natural world provides many examples of multiphase transport and reaction processes that have been optimized by evolution. These phenomena take place at multiple length and time scales and typically include gas-liquid-solid interfaces and capillary phenomena in porous media1,2. Many biological and living systems have evolved to optimize fluidic transport. However, living things are exceptionally complex and very difficult to replicate3-5, and human-made microfluidic devices (which are typically planar and enclosed) are highly limited for multiphase process engineering6-8. Here we introduce the concept of cellular fluidics: a platform of unit-cell-based, three-dimensional structures-enabled by emerging 3D printing methods9,10-for the deterministic control of multiphase flow, transport and reaction processes. We show that flow in these structures can be 'programmed' through architected design of cell type, size and relative density. We demonstrate gas-liquid transport processes such as transpiration and absorption, using evaporative cooling and CO2 capture as examples. We design and demonstrate preferential liquid and gas transport pathways in three-dimensional cellular fluidic devices with capillary-driven and actively pumped liquid flow, and present examples of selective metallization of pre-programmed patterns. Our results show that the design and fabrication of architected cellular materials, coupled with analytical and numerical predictions of steady-state and dynamic behaviour of multiphase interfaces, provide deterministic control of fluidic transport in three dimensions. Cellular fluidics may transform the design space for spatial and temporal control of multiphase transport and reaction processes.

34192670	Three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting is an additive manufacturing process in which the combination of biomaterials and living cells, referred to as a bioink, is deposited layer-by-layer to form biologically active 3D tissue constructs. Recent advancements in the field show that the success of this technology requires the development of novel biomaterials or the improvement of existing bioinks. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is one of the well-known synthetic biomaterials and has been commonly used as a photocrosslinkable bioink for bioprinting; however, other types of cell-friendly crosslinking mechanisms to form PEG hydrogels need to be explored for bioprinting and tissue engineering. In this work, we proposed micro-capillary based bioprinting of a novel molecularly engineered PEG-based bioink that transiently incorporates low molecular weight gelatin (LMWG) fragments. The rheological properties and release profile of the LMWG fragments were characterized, and their presence during hydrogel formation had no effect on the swelling ratio or sol fraction when compared to PEG hydrogels formed without the LMWG fragments. For bioprinting, PEG was first functionalized with cell-adhesive RGD ligands and was then crosslinked using protease-sensitive peptides via a Michael-type addition reaction inside the micro-capillary. The printability was assessed by the analysis of extrudability, shape fidelity, and printing accuracy of the hydrogel filaments after the optimization of the gelation conditions of the PEG-based bioink. The LMWG fragments supplemented into the bioink allowed the extrusion of smooth and uniform cylindrical strands of the hydrogel and improved shape fidelity and printing accuracy. Encapsulated cells in both bioprinted and non-bioprinted PEG-based hydrogels showed high viability and continued to proliferate over time in culture with a well-defined cell morphology depending on the presence of the cell adhesive peptide RGD. The presented micro-capillary based bioprinting process for a novel PEG-based bioink can be promising to construct complex 3D structures with micro-scale range and spatiotemporal variations without using any cytotoxic photoinitiator, UV light, or polymer support.	3D bioprinting of molecularly engineered PEG-based hydrogels utilizing gelatin fragments.	2021	Aug	Piluso Susanna;Skvortsov Gözde Akdeniz;Altunbek Mine;Afghah Ferdows;Khani Navid;Koç Bahattin;Patterson Jennifer	3D constructs;RGD;bioink;hybrid;low molecular weight gelatin fragments;rheology	Biocompatible Materials;Bioprinting;Gelatin;Hydrogels;Printing, Three-Dimensional;Tissue Engineering;Tissue Scaffolds	Biofabrication	Prometheus, Division of Skeletal Tissue Engineering, KU Leuven, O&N 1, Herestraat 49, Box 813, 3000 Leuven, Belgium.;Department of Materials Engineering, KU Leuven, Kasteelpark Arenberg 44, Box 2450, 3001 Leuven, Belgium.;SentryX, Yalelaan 54, 3584 CM Utrecht, The Netherlands.;3D Bioprinting Laboratory, Nanotechnology Research and Application Center, Sabanci University, Orhanli-Tuzla, Istanbul 34956, Turkey.;Faculty of Engineering and Natural Sciences, Sabanci University, Orhanli-Tuzla, Istanbul 34956, Turkey.;3D Bioprinting Laboratory, Nanotechnology Research and Application Center, Sabanci University, Orhanli-Tuzla, Istanbul 34956, Turkey.;Faculty of Engineering and Natural Sciences, Sabanci University, Orhanli-Tuzla, Istanbul 34956, Turkey.;3D Bioprinting Laboratory, Nanotechnology Research and Application Center, Sabanci University, Orhanli-Tuzla, Istanbul 34956, Turkey.;Faculty of Engineering and Natural Sciences, Sabanci University, Orhanli-Tuzla, Istanbul 34956, Turkey.;3D Bioprinting Laboratory, Nanotechnology Research and Application Center, Sabanci University, Orhanli-Tuzla, Istanbul 34956, Turkey.;Faculty of Engineering and Natural Sciences, Sabanci University, Orhanli-Tuzla, Istanbul 34956, Turkey.;3D Bioprinting Laboratory, Nanotechnology Research and Application Center, Sabanci University, Orhanli-Tuzla, Istanbul 34956, Turkey.;Faculty of Engineering and Natural Sciences, Sabanci University, Orhanli-Tuzla, Istanbul 34956, Turkey.;Integrated Manufacturing Technologies Research and Application Center, Sabanci University, Istanbul 34906, Turkey.;Prometheus, Division of Skeletal Tissue Engineering, KU Leuven, O&N 1, Herestraat 49, Box 813, 3000 Leuven, Belgium.;Department of Materials Engineering, KU Leuven, Kasteelpark Arenberg 44, Box 2450, 3001 Leuven, Belgium.;Biomaterials and Regenerative Medicine Group, IMDEA Materials Institute, C/ Eric Kandel 2, Getafe, Madrid 28906, Spain.

34142796	Three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting of photo-cross-linkable hydrogel precursors has attracted great interest in various tissue engineering and drug screening applications, as the biochemical and biophysical properties of the resultant hydrogel structures can be tuned spatiotemporally to provide cells with physiologically relevant microenvironments. In particular, these bioinks benefit from great biofunctional versatility that can be designed to direct cells toward a desired behavior. Despite significant progress in the field, the 3D printing of cell-laden photo-cross-linkable bioinks with low polymer concentrations has remained a challenge, as rapidly stabilizing these bioinks and transforming them to hydrogel filaments is hindered by their low viscosity. Additionally, reaching an optimized print condition has often been challenging due to the large number of print parameters involved in 3D bioprinting setups. Therefore, computational modeling has occasionally been employed to understand the impact of various print parameters and reduce the time and resources required to determine these effects in experimental settings. Here, we report a novel 3D bioprinting strategy for fabricating hydrogel fibrous structures of gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) with superior control over polymer concentration, particularly in a relatively low range from ∼1% (w/v) to 6% (w/v), using a microfluidic printhead. The printhead features a coaxial core-sheath flow, coupled with a photo-cross-linking system, allowing for the in situ cross-linking of GelMA and the generation of hydrogel filaments. A computational model was developed to determine the optimal ranges of process parameters and inform about the diffusive and fluid dynamic behavior of the coaxial flow. The cytocompatibility of the biofabrication system was determined via bioprinting cell-laden bioinks containing U87-MG cells. Notably, the established pipeline from computational modeling to bioprinting has great potential to be applied to a wide range of photo-cross-linkable bioinks to generate living tissues with various material and cellular characteristics.

34116781	Tracheobronchomalacia is a condition of dynamic collapse of the trachea and mainstem bronchi. The clinical significance of tracheobronchomalacia depends on its severity. Mild cases may be medically managed with limited symptomology, while severe cases require advanced therapies, lengthy hospital stays, and carry significant morbidity and mortality. Current therapies for severe tracheobronchomalacia include tracheostomy with prolonged mechanical ventilation, aortopexy, tracheobronchopexy, and intraluminal metallic, silicone, or bioresorbable stents. Three-dimensional (3D)-printed, patient-specific, bioresorbable airway splinting is a novel treatment option that is undergoing investigation in a cohort of critically ill children with severe tracheobronchomalacia. At the time of our last review of our data, 29 splints had been implanted in 15 children with intrathoracic tracheobronchomalacia. The median follow-up was 8.5 months. There were 12 long-term survivors, and all but one lived at home. This article discusses the details of our institution's development and use of 3D-printed, patient-specific, bioresorbable splints for treatment of severe tracheobronchomalacia in the pediatric population.

34116518	Cell alignment plays an essential role in cytoskeleton reorganization, extracellular matrix remodeling, and biomechanical properties regulation of tissues such as vascular tissues, cardiac muscles, and tendons. Based on the natural-oriented features of cells in native tissues, various biomimetic scaffolds have been reported with the introduction of well-arranged ultrafine fibers to induce cell alignment. However, it is still a challenge to fabricate scaffolds with suitable mechanical properties, biomimetic microenvironment, and ability to promote cell alignment. In this paper, we propose an integrated 3D printing system to fabricate multi-scale hierarchical scaffolds combined with meso-, micro-, and nano-fibrous filaments, in which the meso-, micro-, and nano-fibers fabricated via fused deposition modeling, melt electrospining writing, and solution electrospining can provide structural support, promote cell alignment, and create a biomimetic microenvironment to facilitate cell function, respectively. The plasma surface modification was performed improve the surface wettability of the scaffolds by measuring the contact angle. The obtainedin vitrobiological results validate the ability of multi-scale hierarchical scaffolds to enhance cell adhesion and proliferation, and promote cell alignment with the guidance of the aligned microfibers produced via melt electrospining writing in hierarchical scaffolds.

34113451	Identifying areas in the sole of the foot which are routinely overloaded during daily living is extremely important for the management of the diabetic foot. This work showcases the feasibility of reliably detecting overloading using a low-cost non-electronic technique. This technique uses thin-wall structures that change their properties differently when they are repeatedly loaded above or below a tuneable threshold. Flexible hexagonal thin-wall structures were produced using three-dimensional printing, and their mechanical behaviour was assessed before and after repetitive loading at different magnitudes. These structures had an elastic mechanical behaviour until a critical pressure (P crit = 252 kPa ± 17 kPa) beyond which they buckled. Assessing changes in stiffness after simulated use enabled the accurate detection of whether a sample was loaded above or below P crit (sensitivity = 100%, specificity = 100%), with the overloaded samples becoming significantly softer. No specific P crit value was targeted in this study. However, finite-element modelling showed that P crit can be easily raised or lowered, through simple geometrical modifications, to become aligned with established thresholds for overloading (e.g. 200 kPa) or to assess overloading thresholds on a patient-specific basis. Although further research is needed, the results of this study indicate that clinically relevant overloading could indeed be reliably detected without the use of complex electronic in-shoe sensors.

34102923	"Bioprinting is a technique that has been applied in the areas of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine (TERM). Natural polymer-based hydrogels are known for their favorable biocompatible properties, as well as attractive biomaterials for cell encapsulation. These hydrogels provide an aqueous three-dimensional environment with biologically relevant chemical and physical signals, mimicking the natural environment of the extracellular matrix (ECM). Chitosan (CHI) and hyaluronic acid (HA) have been widely researched for biomedical applications. Bioinks are ""ink"" formulations, usually hydrogels, that allow the printing of living cells. This work proposes the development of a low cost and simple chitosan CHI-AH hydrogel with potential to become a bioink. At physiological temperature, the biomaterials form a hydrogel. The material developed was characterized by the analysis of morphology, cytotoxicity, and cell viability. FTIR showed the characteristic vibrational bands of chitosan and HA. No difference in swelling was observed between the different formulations studied, although SEM showed architectural differences between the hydrogels obtained. Extract cytotoxicity testing showed that the hydrogel is not cytotoxic. The direct toxicity test also revealed the absence of toxicity, but the cells had difficulty migrating into the gel, probably because of its density. These data were confirmed by SEM. Further testing are ongoing to better understand the gel's characteristics to improve the limitations found so far."

34071316	The three-dimensional (3D) cell-printing technique has been identified as a new biofabrication platform because of its ability to locate living cells in pre-defined spatial locations with scaffolds and various growth factors. Osseointegrated dental implants have been regarded as very reliable and have long-term reliability. However, host defense mechanisms against infections and micro-movements have been known to be impaired around a dental implant because of the lack of a periodontal ligament. In this study, we fabricated a hybrid artificial organ with a periodontal ligament on the surface of titanium using 3D printing technology. CEMP-1, a known cementogenic factor, was enhanced in vitro. In animal experiments, when the hybrid artificial organ was transplanted to the calvarial defect model, it was observed that the amount of connective tissue increased. 3D-printed hybrid artificial organs can be used with dental implants, establishing physiological tooth functions, including the ability to react to mechanical stimuli and the ability to resist infections.

34043566	Bioinspired hybrid soft robots that combine living and synthetic components are an emerging field in the development of advanced actuators and other robotic platforms (i.e., swimmers, crawlers, and walkers). The integration of biological components offers unique characteristics that artificial materials cannot precisely replicate, such as adaptability and response to external stimuli. Here, we present a skeletal muscle-based swimming biobot with a three-dimensional (3D)-printed serpentine spring skeleton that provides mechanical integrity and self-stimulation during the cell maturation process. The restoring force inherent to the spring system allows a dynamic skeleton compliance upon spontaneous muscle contraction, leading to a cyclic mechanical stimulation process that improves the muscle force output without external stimuli. Optimization of the 3D-printed skeletons is carried out by studying the geometrical stiffnesses of different designs via finite element analysis. Upon electrical actuation of the muscle tissue, two types of motion mechanisms are experimentally observed: directional swimming when the biobot is at the liquid-air interface and coasting motion when it is near the bottom surface. The integrated compliant skeleton provides both the mechanical self-stimulation and the required asymmetry for directional motion, displaying its maximum velocity at 5 hertz (800 micrometers per second, 3 body lengths per second). This skeletal muscle-based biohybrid swimmer attains speeds comparable with those of cardiac-based biohybrid robots and outperforms other muscle-based swimmers. The integration of serpentine-like structures in hybrid robotic systems allows self-stimulation processes that could lead to higher force outputs in current and future biomimetic robotic platforms.

34031353	"BACKGROUND Mosaicplasty osteochondral transplantation (MOT) has been proved a feasible choice for the treatment of talus osteochondral injury. It can reduce ankle pain and allow performance of daily living activities and elementary sports. However, there are very little data on the restoration of normal life with large lesions. Our investigation focused on assessing outcomes in patients with large lesions. MATERIAL AND METHODS The MOT operation was used, and the donor site was located at the lateral condyle of the femur. Clinical evaluation included the Berndt and Harty outcome question, Visual Analog Scale (VAS) pain score (during rest, walking and running), American Orthopedic Foot and ankle Association (AOFAS) score, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective knee evaluation form, and the Short Form 36 (SF-36). Twenty-four months after surgery, the graft binding was assessed by MRI using the magnetic resonance observation of cartilage repair tissue (MOCART) score. RESULTS We assessed 26 patients, including 14 males and 12 females. The average follow-up time was 33.9±5.2 months. The average lesion size was 173.1±23.5 mm². The average VAS score during rest improved from 4.62±0.85 preoperatively to 1.08±0.27 postoperatively (P<0.05), the score during walking improved from 5.19±0.63 preoperatively to 1.15±0.37 postoperatively (P<0.05), and the score during running improved from 6.08±0.74 preoperatively to 1.39±0.57 postoperatively (P<0.05). The average postoperative AOFAS ankle score improved to 91.5±2.6 (range, 88 to 96), compared with preoperative 75.0±2.8 (range, 70 to 79) (P<0.05). Two patients developed pain in the donor site of the knee joint, and both of them had 2 or more osteochondral plugs harvested. The postoperative SF-36 score increased to 92.2±2.4 (P<0.05). In the last follow-up, 18 patients answered the Berndt and Harty outcome question, all with ""good"" as the result. CONCLUSIONS MOT is a feasible choice for patients with larger lesions. It can improve the VAS/AOFAS/IKDC/SF-36 scores, and has high patient satisfaction. Graft incorporation helps improve patient quality of life. Our results indicate that a larger osteochondral plug area increases the risk of developing knee donor site pain."

34028514	Over the last few decades, the world has witnessed multiple viral pandemics, the current severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic being the worst and most devastating one, claiming millions of lives worldwide. Physicians, scientists, and engineers worldwide have joined hands in dealing with the current situation at an impressive speed and efficiency. One of the major reasons for the delay in response is our limited understanding of the mechanism of action and individual effects of the virus on different tissues and organs. Advances in 3D bioprinting have opened up a whole new area to explore and utilize the technology in fabricating models of these tissues and organs, recapitulating in vivo environment. These biomimetic models can not only be utilized in learning the infection pathways and drug toxicology studies but also minimize the need for animal models and shorten the time span for human clinical trials. The current review aims to integrate the existing developments in bioprinting techniques, and their implementation to develop tissue models, which has implications for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Future translation of these models has also been discussed with respect to the pandemic.	3D Bioprinting for fabrication of tissue models of COVID-19 infection.	2021	Aug	Kabir Anisha;Datta Pallab;Oh Julia;Williams Adam;Ozbolat Veli;Unutmaz Derya;T Ozbolat Ibrahim	Coronavirus;bioprinting;microfluidics;tissue models	Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2;Animals;Biomimetics;Bioprinting;Biotechnology;COVID-19;Extracellular Matrix;Genetic Engineering;Humans;Immune System;Lung;Models, Biological;Printing, Three-Dimensional;SARS-CoV-2	Essays in biochemistry	Centre for Healthcare Science and Technology, Indian Institute of Engineering Science and Technology (IIEST) Shibpur, Howrah, West Bengal, India.;Department of Pharmaceutics, National Institute of Pharmaceutical Education and Research (NIPER) Kolkata, West Bengal, India.;Jackson Laboratory for Genomic Medicine and University of Connecticut School of Medicine, Farmington, CT, U.S.A.;Jackson Laboratory for Genomic Medicine and University of Connecticut School of Medicine, Farmington, CT, U.S.A.;Department of Mechanical Engineering, Ceyhan Engineering Faculty, Cukurova University, Adana, Turkey.;Jackson Laboratory for Genomic Medicine and University of Connecticut School of Medicine, Farmington, CT, U.S.A.;The Huck Institutes of The Life Sciences, Penn State University, University Park, PA, U.S.A.;Engineering Science and Mechanics Department, Penn State University, University Park, PA, U.S.A.;Biomedical Engineering Department, Penn State University, University Park, Hershey, PA, U.S.A.;Materials Research Institute, Penn State University, University Park, Hershey, PA, U.S.A.;Department of Neurosurgery, Penn State University, Hershey, PA, U.S.A.

33945130	Facial reconstruction is employed in medical science and archaeology. Though quite popular as anthropological method, it has not so far been used in the orthodox ecclesiastical tradition. This work presents the facial reconstruction of St Eftychios of Crete, who lived between the ninth and tenth centuries. Computed tomography and reverse engineering methods were employed to complete the task. Reconstruction of the mandible and the missing left zygomatic arch was implemented following the Sassouni method. The American method was followed for the soft tissues, with clay deposition of appropriate thickness, on the surface of the skull model. The eyes, nose, and lips were added based on the dimensions of the underlying bone structures. Long hair and beard were added, according to the classic Byzantine tradition pattern of the time period. The final bust developed was then digitized, using a 3D non-contact laser scanner. The 3D geometry produced was employed to produce a mold with vacuum casting techniques. This mold provides the ability to produce copies of the bust, if needed. At the same time, a realistic 3D representation of the Saint's bust was developed, with the aid of special software, in order to compare the traditional forensic reconstruction to the pure digital one. This work is the first case of a Saint's facial reconstruction in the Orthodox Church. The facial reconstruction process, with all the limitations considered, offers the ability to present a realistic aspect of a Greek Orthodox Church Saint, in a form that is easily accessible. Both physical and digital facial reconstruction processes were based on scientific data, so they were as accurate as possible, considering that the mandible was missing in the skull. The facial reconstruction was entirely implemented in Greece creating the basis for similar work in the future. The final bust developed was donated to the Odigitria Monastery, to be exhibited to its visitors.

33922883	Electromechanical sensing devices, based on resins doped with carbon nanotubes, were developed by digital light processing (DLP) 3D printing technology in order to increase design freedom and identify new future and innovative applications. The analysis of electromechanical properties was carried out on specific sensors manufactured by DLP 3D printing technology with complex geometries: a spring, a three-column device and a footstep-sensing platform based on the three-column device. All of them show a great sensitivity of the measured electrical resistance to the applied load and high cyclic reproducibility, demonstrating their versatility and applicability to be implemented in numerous items in our daily lives or in industrial devices. Different types of carbon nanotubes-single-walled, double-walled and multi-walled CNTs (SWCNTs, DWCNTs, MWCNTs)-were used to evaluate the effect of their morphology on electrical and electromechanical performance. SWCNT- and DWCNT-doped nanocomposites presented a higher Tg compared with MWCNT-doped nanocomposites due to a lower UV light shielding effect. This phenomenon also justifies the decrease of nanocomposite Tg with the increase of CNT content in every case. The electromechanical analysis reveals that SWCNT- and DWCNT-doped nanocomposites show a higher electromechanical performance than nanocomposites doped with MWCNTs, with a slight increment of strain sensitivity in tensile conditions, but also a significant strain sensitivity gain at bending conditions.

33911075	Self-healing hydrogels may mimic the behavior of living tissues, which can autonomously repair minor damages, and therefore have a high potential for application in biomedicine. So far, such hydrogels have been processed only via extrusion-based additive manufacturing technology, limited in freedom of design and resolution. Herein, we present 3D-printed hydrogel with self-healing ability, fabricated using only commercially available materials and a commercial Digital Light Processing printer. These hydrogels are based on a semi-interpenetrated polymeric network, enabling self-repair of the printed objects. The autonomous restoration occurs rapidly, at room temperature, and without any external trigger. After rejoining, the samples can withstand deformation and recovered 72% of their initial strength after 12 hours. The proposed approach enables 3D printing of self-healing hydrogels objects with complex architecture, paving the way for future applications in diverse fields, ranging from soft robotics to energy storage.	3D-printed self-healing hydrogels via Digital Light Processing.	2021	Apr	Caprioli Matteo;Roppolo Ignazio;Chiappone Annalisa;Larush Liraz;Pirri Candido Fabrizio;Magdassi Shlomo		Guided Tissue Regeneration;Humans;Hydrogels;Polymers;Printing, Three-Dimensional	Nature communications	Department of Applied Science and Technology, Politecnico di Torino, Turin, Italy.;Casali Center for Applied Chemistry, Institute of Chemistry, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Edmond J.

33898187	Dynamic and reversible assembly of molecules is ubiquitous in the hierarchical superstructures of living systems and plays a key role in cellular functions. Recent work from the laboratory reported on the reversible formation of such superstructures in systems of peptide amphiphiles conjugated to oligonucleotides and electrostatically complimentary peptide sequences. Here, a supramolecular system is reported upon where exchange dynamics and host-guest interactions between β-cyclodextrin and adamantane on peptide amphiphiles lead to superstructure formation. Superstructure formation with bundled nanoribbons generates a mechanically robust hydrogel with a highly porous architecture that can be 3D printed. Functionalization of the porous superstructured material with a biological signal results in a matrix with significant in vitro bioactivity toward neurons that could be used as a supramolecular model to design novel biomaterials.

33882674	Additive manufacturing technologies have progressed in the past decades, especially when used to print biofunctional structures such as scaffolds and vessels with living cells for tissue engineering applications. Part quality and reliability are essential to maintaining the biocompatibility and structural integrity needed for engineered tissue constructs. As a result, it is critical to detect for any anomalies that may occur in the 3D-bioprinting process that can cause a mismatch between the desired designs and printed shapes. However, challenges exist in detecting the imperfections within oftentimes transparent bioprinted and complex printing features accurately and efficiently. In this study, an anomaly detection system based on layer-by-layer sensor images and machine learning algorithms is developed to distinguish and classify imperfections for transparent hydrogel-based bioprinted materials. High anomaly detection accuracy is obtained by utilizing convolutional neural network methods as well as advanced image processing and augmentation techniques on extracted small image patches. Along with the prediction of various anomalies, the category of infill pattern and location information on the image patches can be accurately determined. It is envisioned that using our detection system to categorize and localize printing anomalies, real-time autonomous correction of process parameters can be realized to achieve high-quality tissue constructs in 3D-bioprinting processes.

33856745	The last few decades have witnessed diversified in vitro models to recapitulate the architecture and function of living organs or tissues and contribute immensely to advances in life science. Two novel 3D cell culture models: 1) Organoid, promoted mainly by the developments of stem cell biology and 2) Organ-on-a-chip, enhanced primarily due to microfluidic technology, have emerged as two promising approaches to advance the understanding of basic biological principles and clinical treatments. This review describes the comparable distinct differences between these two models and provides more insights into their complementarity and integration to recognize their merits and limitations for applicable fields. The convergence of the two approaches to produce multi-organoid-on-a-chip or human organoid-on-a-chip is emerging as a new approach for building 3D models with higher physiological relevance. Furthermore, rapid advancements in 3D printing and numerical simulations, which facilitate the design, manufacture, and results-translation of 3D cell culture models, can also serve as novel tools to promote the development and propagation of organoid and organ-on-a-chip systems. Current technological challenges and limitations, as well as expert recommendations and future solutions to address the promising combinations by incorporating organoids, organ-on-a-chip, 3D printing, and numerical simulation, are also summarized.

33798962	Three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting has emerged as a promising approach to fabricate living neural constructs with anatomically accurate complex geometries and spatial distributions of neural stem cells (NSCs) for spinal cord injury (SCI) repair. The NSC-laden 3D bioprinting, however, still faces some big challenges, such as cumbersome printing process, poor cell viability, and minimal cell-material interaction. To address these issues, we have fabricated NSC-laden scaffolds by 3D bioprinting and explore for the first time their application for in vivo SCI repair. In our strategy, we have developed a novel biocompatible bioink consisting of functional chitosan, hyaluronic acid derivatives, and matrigel. This bioink shows fast gelation (within 20 s) and spontaneous covalent crosslinking capability, facilitating convenient one-step bioprinting of spinal cord-like constructs. Thus-fabricated scaffolds maintain high NSC viability (about 95%), and offer a benign microenvironment that facilitates cell-material interactions and neuronal differentiation for optimal formation of neural network. The in vivo experiment has further demonstrated that the bioprinted scaffolds promoted the axon regeneration and decreased glial scar deposition, leading to significant locomotor recovery of the SCI model rats, which may represent a general and versatile strategy for precise engineering of central nervous system and other neural organs/tissues for regenerative medicine application.	3D bioprinted neural tissue constructs for spinal cord injury repair.	2021	May	Liu Xiaoyun;Hao Mingming;Chen Zhongjin;Zhang Ting;Huang Jie;Dai Jianwu;Zhang Zhijun	3D bioprinting;Bioink;Neural stem cells;Neuronal differentiation;Spinal cord injury repair	Animals;Axons;Bioprinting;Printing, Three-Dimensional;Rats;Spinal Cord Injuries;Tissue Engineering;Tissue Scaffolds	Biomaterials	CAS Key Laboratory of Nano-Bio Interface, Division of Nanobiomedicine, Suzhou Institute of Nano-Tech and Nano-Bionics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Suzhou, 215123, China; School of Nano-Tech and Nano-Bionics, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, 230026, China.;I-lab, Key Laboratory of Multifunctional Nanomaterials and Smart Systems, Suzhou Institute of Nano-tech and Nanobionics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Suzhou, 215123, China.;CAS Key Laboratory of Nano-Bio Interface, Division of Nanobiomedicine, Suzhou Institute of Nano-Tech and Nano-Bionics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Suzhou, 215123, China.;I-lab, Key Laboratory of Multifunctional Nanomaterials and Smart Systems, Suzhou Institute of Nano-tech and Nanobionics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Suzhou, 215123, China.;CAS Key Laboratory of Nano-Bio Interface, Division of Nanobiomedicine, Suzhou Institute of Nano-Tech and Nano-Bionics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Suzhou, 215123, China; School of Nano-Tech and Nano-Bionics, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, 230026, China.

33776158	Three-dimensional (3D) printing is a transformative manufacturing strategy, allowing rapid prototyping, customization, and flexible manipulation of structure-property relationships. Proteins are particularly appealing to formulate inks for 3D printing as they serve as essential structural components of living systems, provide a support presence in and around cells and for tissue functions, and also provide the basis for many essential ex vivo secreted structures in nature. Protein-based inks are beneficial in vivo due to their mechanics, chemical and physical match to the specific tissue, and full degradability, while also to promoting implant-host integration and serving as an interface between technology and biology. Exploiting the biological, chemical, and physical features of protein-based inks can provide key opportunities to meet the needs of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Despite these benefits, protein-based inks impose nontrivial challenges to 3D printing such as concentration and rheological features and reconstitution of the structural hierarchy observed in nature that is a source of the robust mechanics and functions of these materials. This review introduces photo-crosslinking mechanisms and rheological principles that underpins a variety of 3D printing techniques. The review also highlights recent advances in the design, development, and biomedical utility of monolithic and composite inks from a range of proteins, including collagen, silk, fibrinogen, and others. One particular focus throughout the review is to introduce unique material characteristics of proteins, including amino acid sequences, molecular assembly, and secondary conformations, which are useful for designing printing inks and for controlling the printed structures. Future perspectives of 3D printing with protein-based inks are also provided to support the promising spectrum of biomedical research accessible to these materials.

The first materials used for this purpose were metals, and in time, novel materials such as ceramics, polymers and composites were introduced to the field to serve in medical applications. In the last decade, the advances in material sciences, cell biology, technology and engineering made 3D printing of living tissues or organ models in the designed structure and geometry possible by using cells alone or together with hydrogels through additive manufacturing. This review aims to give a brief information about the chemical structures and properties of bioink materials and their applications in the production of 3D tissue constructs.

33717856	3D printing has changed the fabrication of advanced materials as it can provide customized and on-demand 3D networks. However, 3D printing of polymer materials with the capacity to be transformed after printing remains a great challenge for engineers, material, and polymer scientists. Radical polymerization has been conventionally used in photopolymerization-based 3D printing, as in the broader context of crosslinked polymer networks. Although this reaction pathway has shown great promise, it offers limited control over chain growth, chain architecture, and thus the final properties of the polymer networks. More fundamentally, radical polymerization produces dead polymer chains incapable of postpolymerization transformations. Alternatively, the application of reversible deactivation radical polymerization (RDRP) to polymer networks allows the tuning of network homogeneity and more importantly, enables the production of advanced materials containing dormant reactivatable species that can be used for subsequent processes in a postsynthetic stage. Consequently, the opportunities that (photoactivated) RDRP-based networks offer have been leveraged through the novel concepts of structurally tailored and engineered macromolecular gels, living additive manufacturing and photoexpandable/transformable-polymer networks. Herein, the advantages of RDRP-based networks over irreversibly formed conventional networks are discussed.

33676234	Tendon injuries are the leading cause of chronic debilitation to patients. Tendon stem/progenitor cells (TSPCs) are potential seed cells for tendon tissue engineering and regeneration, but TSPCs are prone to lose their distinct phenotype in vitro and specific differentiation into the tenocyte lineage is challenging. Utilizing small molecules in an ex vivo culture system may be a promising solution and can significantly improve the therapeutic applications of these cells. Here, by using an image-based, high-throughput screening platform on small molecule libraries, this study established an effective stepwise culture strategy for TSPCs application. The study formulated a cocktail of small molecules which effected proliferation, tenogenesis initiation and maturation phases, and significantly upregulated expression of various tendon-related genes and proteins in TSPCs, which were demonstrated by high-throughput PCR, ScxGFP reporter assay and immunocytochemistry. Furthermore, by combining small molecule-based culture system with 3D printing technology, we embedded living, chemical-empowered TSPCs within a biocompatible hydrogel to engineer tendon grafts, and verified their enhanced ability in promoting functional tendon repair and regeneration both in vivo and in situ. The stepwise culture system for TSPCs and construction of engineered tendon grafts can not only serve as a platform for further studies of underlying molecular mechanisms of tenogenic differentiation, but also provide a new strategy for tissue engineering and development of novel therapeutics for clinical applications.	3D printing of chemical-empowered tendon stem/progenitor cells for functional tissue repair.	2021	Apr	Zhang Yanjie;Lei Tingyun;Tang Chenqi;Chen Yangwu;Liao Youguo;Ju Wei;Zhang Hong;Zhou Bo;Liang Renjie;Zhang Tao;Fan Chunmei;Chen Xiaoyi;Zhao Yanyan;Xie Yuanhao;Ye Jinchun;Heng Boon Chin;Chen Xiao;Hong Yi;Shen Weiliang;Yin Zi	3D printing;High-throughput screening;Small molecule;Stepwise induction;Tendon stem/progenitor cell	Animals;Cell Differentiation;Humans;Printing, Three-Dimensional;Rats;Rats, Sprague-Dawley;Stem Cells;Tendons;Tissue Engineering	Biomaterials	Dr. Li Dak Sum & Yip Yio Chin Center for Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine, Department of Orthopedic Surgery of Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China; Key Laboratory of Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine of Zhejiang Province, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.;Key Laboratory of Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine of Zhejiang Province, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.;Department of Orthopedic Surgery of the Second Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China; Key Laboratory of Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine of Zhejiang Province, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.;Department of Orthopedic Surgery of the Second Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China; Key Laboratory of Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine of Zhejiang Province, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.;Key Laboratory of Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine of Zhejiang Province, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.;Key Laboratory of Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine of Zhejiang Province, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.;Key Laboratory of Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine of Zhejiang Province, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.;Key Laboratory of Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine of Zhejiang Province, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.;Key Laboratory of Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine of Zhejiang Province, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.;Key Laboratory of Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine of Zhejiang Province, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.;Key Laboratory of Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine of Zhejiang Province, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.;Key Laboratory of Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine of Zhejiang Province, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.;Key Laboratory of Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine of Zhejiang Province, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.;Department of Orthopedic Surgery of the Second Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China; Key Laboratory of Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine of Zhejiang Province, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.;Department of Orthopedic Surgery of the Second Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China; Key Laboratory of Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine of Zhejiang Province, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.;Peking University School of Stomatology, Beijing, China.;Department of Orthopedic Surgery of the Second Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China; Key Laboratory of Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine of Zhejiang Province, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China; China Orthopaedic Regenerative Medicine (CORMed), Hangzhou, China.;Department of Orthopedic Surgery of the Second Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China; Key Laboratory of Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine of Zhejiang Province, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China; China Orthopaedic Regenerative Medicine (CORMed), Hangzhou, China.;Department of Orthopedic Surgery of the Second Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China; Key Laboratory of Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine of Zhejiang Province, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China; China Orthopaedic Regenerative Medicine (CORMed), Hangzhou, China.

33649412	Jawbone differs from other bones in many aspects, including its developmental origin and the occurrence of jawbone-specific diseases like MRONJ (medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw). Although there is a strong need, adequate in vitro models of this unique environment are sparse to date. While previous approaches are reliant e.g. on scaffolds or spheroid culture, 3D bioprinting enables free-form fabrication of complex living tissue structures. In the present work, production of human jawbone models was realised via projection-based stereolithography. Constructs were bioprinted containing primary jawbone-derived osteoblasts and vasculature-like channel structures optionally harbouring primary endothelial cells. After 28 days of cultivation in growth medium or osteogenic medium, expression of cell type-specific markers was confirmed on both the RNA and protein level, while prints maintained their overall structure. Survival of endothelial cells in the printed channels, co-cultured with osteoblasts in medium without supplementation of endothelial growth factors, was demonstrated. Constructs showed not only mineralisation, being one of the characteristics of osteoblasts, but also hinted at differentiation to an osteocyte phenotype. These results indicate the successful biofabrication of an in vitro model of the human jawbone, which presents key features of this special bone entity and hence appears promising for application in jawbone-specific research.	3D bioprinting of tissue-specific osteoblasts and endothelial cells to model the human jawbone.	2021	Mar	Amler Anna-Klara;Thomas Alexander;Tüzüner Selin;Lam Tobias;Geiger Michel-Andreas;Kreuder Anna-Elisabeth;Palmer Chris;Nahles Susanne;Lauster Roland;Kloke Lutz		Bioprinting;Coculture Techniques;Endothelial Cells;Humans;Jaw;Osteoblasts;Printing, Three-Dimensional;Tissue Engineering;Tissue Scaffolds	Scientific reports	Cellbricks GmbH, Gustav-Meyer-Allee 25, 13355, Berlin, Germany. aka@cellbricks.com.;Department of Medical Biotechnology, Technische Universität Berlin, Gustav-Meyer-Allee 25, 13355, Berlin, Germany. aka@cellbricks.com.;Cellbricks GmbH, Gustav-Meyer-Allee 25, 13355, Berlin, Germany.;Department of Medical Biotechnology, Technische Universität Berlin, Gustav-Meyer-Allee 25, 13355, Berlin, Germany.;Cellbricks GmbH, Gustav-Meyer-Allee 25, 13355, Berlin, Germany.;Department of Medical Biotechnology, Technische Universität Berlin, Gustav-Meyer-Allee 25, 13355, Berlin, Germany.;Cellbricks GmbH, Gustav-Meyer-Allee 25, 13355, Berlin, Germany.;Cellbricks GmbH, Gustav-Meyer-Allee 25, 13355, Berlin, Germany.;Cellbricks GmbH, Gustav-Meyer-Allee 25, 13355, Berlin, Germany.;Department of Medical Biotechnology, Technische Universität Berlin, Gustav-Meyer-Allee 25, 13355, Berlin, Germany.;Cellbricks GmbH, Gustav-Meyer-Allee 25, 13355, Berlin, Germany.;Department of Oral- and Maxillofacial Surgery, Charité Campus Virchow, Augustenburger Platz 1, 13353, Berlin, Germany.;Department of Medical Biotechnology, Technische Universität Berlin, Gustav-Meyer-Allee 25, 13355, Berlin, Germany.;Cellbricks GmbH, Gustav-Meyer-Allee 25, 13355, Berlin, Germany.

33601340	Extrusion bioprinting has been widely used to extrude continuous filaments of bioink (or the mixture of biomaterial and living cells), layer-by-layer, to build three-dimensional constructs for biomedical applications. In extrusion bioprinting, printability is an important parameter used to measure the difference between the designed construct and the one actually printed. This difference could be caused by the extrudability of printed bioink and/or the structural formability and stability of printed constructs. Although studies have reported in characterizing printability based on the bioink properties and printing process, the concept of printability is often confusingly and, sometimes, conflictingly used in the literature. The objective of this perspective is to define the printability for extrusion bioprinting in terms of extrudability, filament fidelity, and structural integrity, as well as to review the effect of bioink properties, bioprinting process, and construct design on the printability. Challenges related to the printability of extrusion bioprinting are also discussed, along with recommendations for improvements.

33585711	Additive manufacturing (AM) is among the most attractive methods to produce implants, the processes are very swift and it can be precisely controlled to meet patient's requirement since they can be produced in exact shape, dimension, and even texture of different living tissues. Until now, lots of methods have emerged and used in this field with diverse characteristics. This review aims to comprehensively discuss 3D printing (3DP) technologies to manufacture metallic implants, especially on techniques and procedures. Various technologies based on their main properties are categorized, the effecting parameters are introduced, and the history of AM technology is briefly analyzed. Subsequently, the utilization of these AM-manufactured components in medicine along with their effectual variables is discussed, and special attention is paid on to the production of porous scaffolds, taking pore size, density, etc., into consideration. Finally, 3DP of the popular metallic systems in medical applications such as titanium, Ti6Al4V, cobalt-chromium alloys, and shape memory alloys are studied. In general, AM manufactured implants need to comply with important requirements such as biocompatibility, suitable mechanical properties (strength and elastic modulus), surface conditions, custom-built designs, fast production, etc. This review aims to introduce the AM technologies in implant applications and find new ways to design more sophisticated methods and compatible implants that mimic the desired tissue functions.	3D Printing Technologies in Metallic Implants: A Thematic Review on the Techniques and Procedures.	2021		Attarilar Shokouh;Ebrahimi Mahmoud;Djavanroodi Faramarz;Fu Yuanfei;Wang Liqiang;Yang Junlin	3D printing techniques;Additive manufacturing;Biometals;Implants;Porous scaffolds		International journal of bioprinting	Department of Pediatric Orthopaedics, Xinhua Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University, School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.;State Key Laboratory of Metal Matrix Composites, School of Material Science and Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.;National Engineering Research Center of Light Alloy Net Forming, School of Materials Science and Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.;Department of Mechanical Engineering, College of Engineering, Prince Mohammad Bin Fahd University, Al Khobar, KSA.;Department of Mechanical Engineering, Imperial College London, London, UK.;Ninth People's Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai 200011, China.;State Key Laboratory of Metal Matrix Composites, School of Material Science and Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.;Department of Pediatric Orthopaedics, Xinhua Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University, School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.

33579053	Sustaining the vital functions of cells outside the organism requires strictly defined parameters. In order to ensure their optimal growth and development, it is necessary to provide a range of nutrients and regulators. Hydrogels are excellent materials for 3D in vitro cell cultures. Their ability to retain large amounts of liquid, as well as their biocompatibility, soft structures, and mechanical properties similar to these of living tissues, provide appropriate microenvironments that mimic extracellular matrix functions. The wide range of natural and synthetic polymeric materials, as well as the simplicity of their physico-chemical modification, allow the mechanical properties to be adjusted for different requirements. Sodium alginate-based hydrogel is a frequently used material for cell culture. The lack of cell-interactive properties makes this polysaccharide the most often applied in combination with other materials, including gelatin. The combination of both materials increases their biological activity and improves their material properties, making this combination a frequently used material in 3D printing technology. The use of hydrogels as inks in 3D printing allows the accurate manufacturing of scaffolds with complex shapes and geometries. The aim of this paper is to provide an overview of the materials used for 3D cell cultures, which are mainly alginate-gelatin hydrogels, including their properties and potential applications.

33572757	Breast cancer commonly metastasizes to bone, resulting in osteolytic lesions and poor patient quality of life. The bone extracellular matrix (ECM) plays a critical role in cancer cell metastasis by means of the physical and biochemical cues it provides to support cellular crosstalk. Current two-dimensional in-vitro models lack the spatial and biochemical complexities of the native ECM and do not fully recapitulate crosstalk that occurs between the tumor and endogenous stromal cells. Engineered models such as bone-on-a-chip, extramedullary bone, and bioreactors are presently used to model cellular crosstalk and bone-tumor cell interactions, but fall short of providing a bone-biomimetic microenvironment. Three-dimensional bioprinting allows for the deposition of biocompatible materials and living cells in complex architectures, as well as provides a means to better replicate biological tissue niches in-vitro. In cancer research specifically, 3D constructs have been instrumental in seminal work modeling cancer cell dissemination to bone and bone-tumor cell crosstalk in the skeleton. Furthermore, the use of biocompatible materials, such as hydroxyapatite, allows for printing of bone-like microenvironments with the ability to be implanted and studied in in-vivo animal models. Moreover, the use of bioprinted models could drive the development of novel cancer therapies and drug delivery vehicles.

33555185	Remote manipulation of a micromachine under an external magnetic field is significant in a variety of applications. However, magnetic manipulation requires that either the target objects or the fluids should be ferromagnetic or superparamagnetic. To extend the applicability, we propose a versatile optical printing technique termed femtosecond laser-directed bubble microprinting (FsLDBM) for on-demand magnetic encoding. Harnessing Marangoni convection, evaporation flow, and capillary force for long-distance delivery, near-field attraction, and printing, respectively, FsLDBM is capable of printing nanomaterials on the solid-state substrate made of arbitrary materials. As a proof-of-concept, we actuate a 3D polymer microturbine under a rotating magnetic field by implementing γ-Fe2O3 nanomagnets on its blade. Moreover, we demonstrate the magnetic encoding on a living daphnia and versatile manipulation of the hybrid daphnia. With its general applicability, the FsLDBM approach provides opportunities for magnetic control of general microstructures in a variety of applications, such as smart microbots and biological microsurgery.

33522013	Living organisms in nature have amazing control over their color, shape, and morphology in response to environmental stimuli for camouflage, communication, or reproduction. Inspired by the camouflage of the octopus via the elongation or contraction of its pigment cells, oblate cholesteric liquid crystal droplets are dispersed in a polymer matrix, serving as the role of pigment cells and showing structural color due to selective Bragg reflection by their periodic helical structure. The color of 3D-printed biomimetic systems can be tuned by changing the helical pitch via the chiral dopant concentration or temperature. When the oblate liquid crystal droplets are heated up to isotropic, the opaque and colored biomimetic systems become transparent and colorless. Meanwhile, the isotropic liquid crystal droplets tend to become spherical, causing volume contraction along the film plane and volume dilation in the perpendicular direction. The internal strain combined with the gradient distribution of the oblate isotropic liquid crystal droplets result in corresponding shape transformations. The camouflage of a biomimetic octopus and the blossom of a biomimetic flower, both of which show synergetic color and shape responses, are demonstrated to inspire the design of functional materials and intelligent devices.	3D-Printed Biomimetic Systems with Synergetic Color and Shape Responses Based on Oblate Cholesteric Liquid Crystal Droplets.	2021	Mar	Yang Chenjing;Wu Baiheng;Ruan Jian;Zhao Peng;Chen Li;Chen Dong;Ye Fangfu	3D printing;biomimetics;droplets;liquid crystals;stimulus response		Advanced materials (Deerfield Beach, Fla.)

33511846	Pectin hydrogel is a soft hydrocolloid with multifaceted utilities in the food sector. Substantial knowledge acquired on the gelation mechanisms and structure-function relationship of pectin has led to interesting functions of pectin hydrogel. Food applications of pectin hydrogels can be categorized under four headings: food ingredients/additives, food packaging, bioactive delivery and health management. The cross-linked and tangly three-dimensional structure of pectin gel renders it an ideal choice of wall material for the encapsulation of biomolecules and living cells; as a fat replacer and texturizer. Likewise, pectin hydrogel is an effective satiety inducer due to its ability to swell under the simulated gastric and intestinal conditions without losing its gel structure. Coating or composites of pectin hydrogel with proteins and other polysaccharides augment its functionality as an encapsulant, satiety-inducer and food packaging material. Low-methoxyl pectin gel is an appropriate food ink for 3D printing applications due to its viscoelastic properties, adaptable microstructure and texture properties. This review aims at explaining all the applications of pectin hydrogels, as mentioned above. A comprehensive discussion is presented on the approaches by which pectin hydrogel can be transformed as a resourceful material by controlling its dimensions, state, and rheology. The final sections of this article emphasize the recent research trends in this discipline, such as the development of smart hydrogels, injectable gels, aerogels, xerogels and oleogels from pectin.

33501353	The field of rehabilitation and assistive devices is being disrupted by innovations in desktop 3D printers and open-source designs. For upper limb prosthetics, those technologies have demonstrated a strong potential to aid those with missing hands. However, there are basic interfacing issues that need to be addressed for long term usage. The functionality, durability, and the price need to be considered especially for those in difficult living conditions. We evaluated the most popular designs of body-powered, 3D printed prosthetic hands. We selected a representative sample and evaluated its suitability for its grasping postures, durability, and cost. The prosthetic hand can perform three grasping postures out of the 33 grasps that a human hand can do. This corresponds to grasping objects similar to a coin, a golf ball, and a credit card. Results showed that the material used in the hand and the cables can withstand a 22 N normal grasping force, which is acceptable based on standards for accessibility design. The cost model showed that a 3D printed hand could be produced for as low as $19. For the benefit of children with congenital missing limbs and for the war-wounded, the results can serve as a baseline study to advance the development of prosthetic hands that are functional yet low-cost.

33499750	Bioprinting of body tissues has gained great attention in recent years due to its unique advantages, including the creation of complex geometries and printing the patient-specific tissues with various drug and cell types. The most momentous part of the bioprinting process is bioink, defined as a mixture of living cells and biomaterials (especially hydrogels). Among different biomaterials, natural polymers are the best choices for hydrogel-based bioinks due to their intrinsic biocompatibility and minimal inflammatory response in body condition. Gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) hydrogel is one of the high-potential hydrogel-based bioinks due to its easy synthesis with low cost, great biocompatibility, transparent structure that is useful for cell monitoring, photocrosslinkability, and cell viability. Furthermore, the potential of adjusting properties of GelMA due to the synthesis protocol makes it a suitable choice for soft or hard tissues. In this review, different methods for the bioprinting of GelMA-based bioinks, as well as various effective process parameters, are reviewed. Also, several solutions for challenges in the printing of GelMA-based bioinks are discussed, and applications of GelMA-based bioprinted tissues argued as well. Impact statement Bioprinting has been demonstrated as a promising and alternative approach for organ transplantation to develop various types of living tissue. Bioinks, with great biological characteristics similar to the host tissues and rheological/flow features, are the first requirements for the successful bioprinting approach. Gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) hydrogel is one of the high-potential hydrogel-based bioinks. This review provides a comprehensive look at different methods for the bioprinting of GelMA-based bioinks and applications of GelMA-based bioprinted tissues for tissue repair.

33493549	Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) of the oral cavity can present with pain, swelling and radiolucent lesion mimicking endodontic diseases. This article reports on a case of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma initially diagnosed and treated as periodontal disease and then endodontic disease in the maxillary anterior and premolar area of a 40-year old female. A cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) image of the lesion was taken. The lesion was segmented using Mimics software (Materialise NV, Lueven, Belgium). Three-dimensional models of the tumor were printed. During the surgical phase teeth #4, 6, and 7 were extracted and biopsy samples were obtained. Histopathologic examination showed invasive sheets of large, atypical, basophilic cells strongly and diffusely positive for CD20. Three-dimensional analysis, segmentation, and printing of radiolucent lesions of the jaws assists with differential diagnosis and efficient treatment. Oral health professionals can play a crucial role in the early detection and diagnosis of oral NHL, thereby preventing extensive loss of function and esthetics, and even saving lives.

33469856	Persons with upper-limb amputations face severe problems due to a reduction in their ability to perform the activities of daily living. The prosthesis controlled by electromyography (EMG) or other signals from sensors, switches, accelerometers, etc., can somewhat regain the lost capability of such individuals. However, there are several issues with these prostheses, such as expensive cost, limited functionality, unnatural control, slow operating speed, complexity, heavyweight, large size, etc. This paper proposes an affordable transradial prosthesis, controlled by the muscular contractions from user intention. A surface EMG sensor was explicitly fabricated for capturing the muscle contraction information from the residual forearm of subjects with amputation. An under actuated 3D printed hand was developed with a prosthetic socket assembly to attach the remaining upper-limb of such subjects. The hand integrates an intuitive closed-loop control system that receives reference input from the designed sensor and feedback input from a force sensor installed at the thumb tip. The performance of the EMG sensor was compared with that of a traditional sensor in detecting muscle contractions from the subjects. The designed sensor showed a good correlation (r > 0.93) and a better signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) feature to the conventional sensor. Further, a successful trial of the developed hand prosthesis was made on five different subjects with transradial amputation. The users wearing the hand prototype were able to perform faster and delicate grasping of various objects. The implemented control system allowed the prosthesis users to control the grasp force of hand fingers with their intention of muscular contractions.

33466904	Reconstruction of segmental bone defects by autologous bone grafting is still the standard of care but presents challenges including anatomical availability and potential donor site morbidity. The process of 3D bioprinting, the application of 3D printing for direct fabrication of living tissue, opens new possibilities for highly personalized tissue implants, making it an appealing alternative to autologous bone grafts. One of the most crucial hurdles for the clinical application of 3D bioprinting is the choice of a suitable cell source, which should be minimally invasive, with high osteogenic potential, with fast, easy expansion. In this study, mesenchymal progenitor cells were isolated from clinically relevant human bone biopsy sites (explant cultures from alveolar bone, iliac crest and fibula; bone marrow aspirates; and periosteal bone shaving from the mastoid) and 3D bioprinted using projection-based stereolithography. Printed constructs were cultivated for 28 days and analyzed regarding their osteogenic potential by assessing viability, mineralization, and gene expression. While viability levels of all cell sources were comparable over the course of the cultivation, cells obtained by periosteal bone shaving showed higher mineralization of the print matrix, with gene expression data suggesting advanced osteogenic differentiation. These results indicate that periosteum-derived cells represent a highly promising cell source for translational bioprinting of bone tissue given their superior osteogenic potential as well as their minimally invasive obtainability.

33455952	Leveraging 3D bioprinting for processing stem cell-laden biomaterials has unlocked a tremendous potential for fabricating living 3D constructs for bone tissue engineering. Even though several bioinks developed to date display suitable physicochemical properties for stem cell seeding and proliferation, they generally lack the nanosized minerals present in native bone bioarchitecture. To enable the bottom-up fabrication of biomimetic 3D constructs for bioinstructing stem cells pro-osteogenic differentiation, herein we developed multi-bioactive nanocomposite bioinks that combine the organic and inorganic building blocks of bone. For the organic component gelatin methacrylate (GelMA), a photocrosslinkable denaturated collagen derivative used for 3D bioprinting was selected due to its rheological properties display of cell adhesion moieties to which bone tissue precursors such as human bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (hBM-MSCs) can attach to. The inorganic building block was formulated by incorporating mesoporous silica nanoparticles functionalized with calcium, phosphate and dexamethasone (MSNCaPDex), which previously proven to induce osteogenic differentiation. The newly formulated photocrosslinkable nanocomposite GelMA bioink incorporating MSNCaPDex nanoparticles and laden with hBM-MSCs was successfully processed into a 3D bioprintable construct with structural fidelity, and well dispersed nanoparticles throughout the hydrogel matrix. These nanocomposite constructs could induce the deposition of apatitein vitro, thus showing attractive bioactivity properties. Viability and differentiation studies showed that hBM-MSCs remained viable and exhibited osteogenic differentiation biomarkers when incorporated in GelMA/MSNCaPDex constructs and without requiring further biochemical, nor mechanical stimuli. Overall, our nanocomposite bioink has demonstrated excellent processability via extrusion bioprinting into osteogenic constructs with potential application in bone tissue repair and regeneration.

33446076	"Three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting is an emerging tissue engineering technology, already with several remarkable accomplishments and with more promises to fulfill. Besides the enduring goal of making tissues for implantation, it could also become an essential tool in the worldwide trend to replace animal experimentation with improved in vitro models for disease mechanism studies, or with new high-throughput pharmacological and toxicology assays. All these require the speed, reproducibility, and standardization that bioprinting could easily provide. However, originating from additive manufacturing with its top-down approach of ""filling"" a virtual volume with a semifluid (hydrogel) material, the finer internal anatomic structure of the tissues, as well as vascularization and innervation, has remained difficult to implement. Thus, the next frontier in bioprinting is the generation of more anatomically realistic models, needed for ascending to the functionality of living tissues. In this study, I discuss the conceptual and practical barriers still hampering the attainment of this goal and suggest solutions to overcome them. In this regard, I introduce two workflows that combine existing methods in new operational sequences: (1) bioprinting guided by images of histological sections assembled in 3D constructs and (2) bioprinting of bidimensional vascular patterns implemented among stackable cellular layers. While more sophisticated methods to capture the tissue structure in 3D constructs certainly exist, I contend that extrusion bioprinting may still offer a simple, practical, and affordable option. Impact statement Paucity of anatomic structural details is one of the limitations of three-dimensional bioprinting toward fulfilling its potential for tissue engineering, drug testing, and toxicological assays. The origins of this problem can be tracked back to derivation of bioprinting from inorganic additive manufacturing, making it more adept to render the shapes of the objects than their content. As solutions, I suggest two simple workflows that can be implemented by most current bioprinters, based on the import into the construct design of anatomically realistic structural information. If more largely adopted, these and similar approaches may significantly improve the applicability of bioprinted constructs."

33431680	The mechanical properties of engineering structures continuously weaken during service life because of material fatigue or degradation. By contrast, living organisms are able to strengthen their mechanical properties by regenerating parts of their structures. For example, plants strengthen their cell structures by transforming photosynthesis-produced glucose into stiff polysaccharides. In this work, we realize hybrid materials that use photosynthesis of embedded chloroplasts to remodel their microstructures. These materials can be used to three-dimensionally (3D)-print functional structures, which are endowed with matrix-strengthening and crack healing when exposed to white light. The mechanism relies on a 3D-printable polymer that allows for an additional cross-linking reaction with photosynthesis-produced glucose in the material bulk or on the interface. The remodeling behavior can be suspended by freezing chloroplasts, regulated by mechanical preloads, and reversed by environmental cues. This work opens the door for the design of hybrid synthetic-living materials, for applications such as smart composites, lightweight structures, and soft robotics.

33428695	3D bioprinting has been increasingly employed in skin tissue engineering for manufacturing living constructs with three-dimensional spatial precision and controlled architecture. There is however, a bottleneck in the tunability of bioinks to address specific biocompatibility challenges, functional traits and printability. Here we report on a traditional gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) based bioink, tuned by addition of an ulvan type polysaccharide, isolated from a cultivated source of a specific Australian Ulvacean macroalgae (Ul84). Ul84 is a sulfate- and rhamnose-rich polysaccharide, resembling mammalian glycosaminoglycans that are involved in wound healing and tissue matrix structure and function. Printable bioinks were developed by addition of methacrylated Ul84 (UlMA) to GelMA solutions. The inclusion of UlMA in the bioinks facilitated the extrusion printing process by reducing yield stress. The resultant printed structures containing ulvan exhibited improved mechanical strength and regulated the rate of scaffold degradation. The 3D printed cell-laden structures with human dermal fibroblasts demonstrated high cell viability, support of cell proliferation and dermal-like properties as evidenced by the deposition of key dermal extracellular matrix components including collagen I, collagen III, elastin and fibronectin. In vitro degradation suggested the role of UlMA in supporting structural stability of the printed cellular structures. Taken together, the present work demonstrates progression towards a biocompatible and biofunctional ink that simultaneously delivers improved mechanical, structural and stability traits that are important in facilitating real world applications in skin tissue repair.	3D bioprinting dermal-like structures using species-specific ulvan.	2021	Apr	Chen Xifang;Yue Zhilian;Winberg Pia C;Lou Yan-Ru;Beirne Stephen;Wallace Gordon G		Animals;Australia;Bioprinting;Humans;Polysaccharides;Printing, Three-Dimensional;Tissue Engineering;Tissue Scaffolds	Biomaterials science	ARC Centre of Excellence for Electromaterials Science, Intelligent Polymer Research Institute, Innovation Campus, University of Wollongong, NSW 2500, Australia. zyue@uow.edu.au gwallace@uow.edu.au.

33412840	Bioprinting has become an important tool for fabricating regenerative implants and in vitro cell culture platforms. However, until today, extrusion-based bioprinting processes are limited to resolutions of hundreds of micrometers, which hamper the reproduction of intrinsic functions and morphologies of living tissues. This study describes novel hydrogel-based bioinks for cell electrowriting (CEW) of well-organized cell-laden fiber structures with diameters ranging from 5 to 40 μm. Two novel photoresponsive hydrogel bioinks, that is, based on gelatin and silk fibroin, which display distinctly different gelation chemistries, are introduced. The rapid photomediated cross-linking mechanisms, electrical conductivity, and viscosity of these two engineered bioinks allow the fabrication of 3D ordered fiber constructs with small pores (down to 100 μm) with different geometries (e.g., squares, hexagons, and curved patterns) of relevant thicknesses (up to 200 μm). Importantly, the biocompatibility of the gelatin- and silk fibroin-based bioinks enables the fabrication of cell-laden constructs, while maintaining high cell viability post printing. Taken together, CEW and the two hydrogel bioinks open up fascinating opportunities to manufacture microstructured constructs for applications in regenerative medicine and in vitro models that can better resemble cellular microenvironments.

33411512	Three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting is a technology that can precisely fabricate customized tissues and organs. Hydrogel materials that can embed living cells for use in 3D printing are called bioinks. However, there are only limited options of bioinks currently because they require the following features at once, such as printability, repetitive layer-by-layer stacking (stackability), structure stabilization, and biological properties. A polyurethane-gelatin double network hydrogel bioink was previously reported to own tunable modulus through changing the solid content, but cell viability at the high solid content is inevitably reduced. In the present study, the reinforcement effects of a metal-organic framework (MOF), zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8), in the PUG bioink were evaluated. The printability, stackability, thermoresponsiveness, and shear-thinning behavior of the PUG-ZIF-8 composite hydrogels were examined. It was found that the PUG composite hydrogel containing 1250 μg/mL ZIF-8 crystals showed significant structural stability and modulus enhancement (∼2.5-fold). However, the PUG bioink containing 1250 μg/mL ZIF-8 crystals may lead to cell senescence or death. The cytocompatible concentration of ZIF-8 crystals in the bioink was about 875 μg/mL, and this concentration was much higher than the reported tolerable amount (∼50 μg/mL) of ZIF-8 for biomedical applications. The strong reinforcement effect of ZIF-8 and the drug-loading/sensing possibilities of MOFs may open new opportunities for using MOFs in 3D bioprinting applications.

33376679	Bioprinting is a rapidly expanding technology with the ability to fabricate in vitro three-dimensional (3D) tissues in a layer-by-layer manner to ultimately produce a living tissue which physiologically resembles native in vivo tissue functionality. Unfortunately, large costs associated with commercially available bioprinters severely limit access to the technology. We investigated the potential for modifying a low-cost commercially available RepRap Prusa iteration 3 (i3) 3D printer with an open-source syringe-housed microextrusion print-head unit (universal paste extruder by Richard Horne, RichRap), that allowed for controlled deposition of cell-laden bioinks and Freeform Reversible Embedding of Suspended Hydrogels (FRESH) method-based printing.

33301844	Local delivery of drugs, proteins and living cells with on demand release manner using porous scaffolds has been widely used in the field of tissue engineering and cancer therapies. Drugs directly loaded in the porous scaffolds, are generally prone to free diffuse especially for long term incubation. Herein, in this study, hollow fiber alginate/iron oxide nanoparticles scaffolds were prepared by coaxial 3D printing with drugs, protein or living cells encapsulating in the core part (low concentration of alginate gels). Magnetically-driven on demand release was realized by extruding the loaded drugs, proteins and cells from the core part of the hollow fibers due to the deformation of the scaffolds under magnetic field. Additionally, the hollow fibers could sever as diffusion barriers to reduce uncontrolled diffusion of drugs, proteins and cells from scaffolds in the conditions of no required stimulation. The factors influencing the deformation of the scaffolds, as well as the release behavior were investigated. The data indicated that the scaffolds prepared by 10 wt% of alginate with 13% of iron oxide nanoparticles after crosslinking using 0.1 M CaCl2 solution for 10 s showed repeated on demand release capability in vitro and in vivo under intermittently magnetic stimulation. Thus, this 3D printed alginate/iron oxide nanoparticles hollow scaffolds with on demand controlled delivery capability may prove useful for tissue engineering and disease therapies.

33285324	Living cells are highly scalable biological actuators found in nature, and they are efficient technological solutions to actuate robotic systems. Recent advancements in biofabrication and tissue engineering have bridged the gap to interface muscle cells with artificial technology. In this review, we summarize the recent progress in engineering the attributes of individual components for the development of fully functional biohybrid robots.

33264417	Bioprinting is a rapidly developing technology that enables the exact positioning of living cells embedded in bio-materials in precise spatial arrangements to fabricate engineered tissues and organs. While the ultimate goal of bio­printing approaches is to produce organs for transplantation purposes, bioprinted organ models also hold great potential for research purposes to serve as alternatives to animal experiments. By using human cells, humanized organ models can be generated that may produce more relevant results for human (patho-)physiology than animal models. However, standard bioprinting procedures currently use numerous hidden animal components. Virtually all studies published in the field to date make use of cells grown in media with fetal bovine serum (FBS). In addition, Matrigel, the extracellular matrix (ECM) harvested from Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm sarcoma grown in mice, is widely employed to cultivate stem cells and 3D organ models. Finally, most bioinks currently in use contain gelatin or comparable animal components to improve cell viability and adhesion. The present review will give an introduction to the potential of bioprinting to fabricate 3D models that may be substituted for animal experiments and will go on to describe strategies to replace animal components cur­rently included in standard procedures of bioprinting. These approaches comprise the adaptation of cells to FBS-free media, the use of bioinks composed of synthetic or plant material, and the replacement of animal ingredients by materials of human origin. We propose denoting bioprinting strategies devoid of animal components as clean bioprinting.

33221501	Extrusion-based 3D printing followed by debinding and sintering is a powerful approach that allows for the fabrication of porous scaffolds from materials (or material combinations) that are otherwise very challenging to process using other additive manufacturing techniques. Iron is one of the materials that have been recently shown to be amenable to processing using this approach. Indeed, a fully interconnected porous design has the potential of resolving the fundamental issue regarding bulk iron, namely a very low rate of biodegradation. However, no extensive evaluation of the biodegradation behavior and properties of porous iron scaffolds made by extrusion-based 3D printing has been reported. Therefore, the in vitro biodegradation behavior, electrochemical response, evolution of mechanical properties along with biodegradation, and responses of an osteoblastic cell line to the 3D printed iron scaffolds were studied. An ink formulation, as well as matching 3D printing, debinding and sintering conditions, was developed to create iron scaffolds with a porosity of 67%, a pore interconnectivity of 96%, and a strut density of 89% after sintering. X-ray diffracometry confirmed the presence of the α-iron phase in the scaffolds without any residuals from the rest of the ink. Owing to the presence of geometrically designed macropores and random micropores in the struts, the in vitro corrosion rate of the scaffolds was much improved as compared to the bulk counterpart, with 7% mass loss after 28 days. The mechanical properties of the scaffolds remained in the range of those of trabecular bone despite 28 days of in vitro biodegradation. The direct culture of MC3T3-E1 preosteoblasts on the scaffolds led to a substantial reduction in living cell count, caused by a high concentration of iron ions, as revealed by the indirect assays. On the other hand, the ability of the cells to spread and form filopodia indicated the cytocompatibility of the corrosion products. Taken together, this study shows the great potential of extrusion-based 3D printed porous iron to be further developed as a biodegradable bone substituting biomaterial.

33218292	To realize the promise of three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting, it is imperative to develop bioinks that possess the necessary biological and rheological characteristics for printing cell-laden tissue grafts. Alginate is widely used as a bioink because its rheological properties can be modified through precrosslinking or the addition of thickening agents to increase printing resolution. However, modification of alginate's physiochemical characteristics using common crosslinking agents can affect its cytocompatibility. Therefore, we evaluated the printability, physicochemical properties, and osteogenic potential of four common alginate bioinks: alginate-CaCl2 (alg-CaCl2), alginate-CaSO4 (alg-CaSO4), alginate-gelatin (alg-gel), and alginate-nanocellulose (alg-ncel) for the 3D bioprinting of anatomically accurate osteogenic grafts. While all bioinks possessed similar viscosity, printing fidelity was lower in the precrosslinked bioinks. When used to print geometrically defined constructs, alg-CaSO4 and alg-ncel exhibited higher mechanical properties and lower mesh size than those printed with alg-CaCl2 or alg-gel. The physical properties of these constructs affected the biological performance of encapsulated bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs). Cell-laden constructs printed using alg-CaSO4 and alg-ncel exhibited greater cell apoptosis and contained fewer living cells 7 days postprinting. In addition, effective cell-matrix interactions were only observed in alg-CaCl2 printed constructs. When cultured in osteogenic media, MSCs in alg-CaCl2 constructs exhibited increased osteogenic differentiation compared to the other three bioinks. This bioink was then used to 3D print anatomically accurate cell-laden scaphoid bones that were capable of partial mineralization after 14 days of in vitro culture. These results highlight the importance of bioink properties to modulate cell behavior and the biofabrication of clinically relevant bone tissues. Impact statement Alginate-based bioinks are widely used for three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting of bone tissues. However, a direct systematic comparison between alginate-based bioinks is needed to assess the optimal bioink properties for mesenchymal stromal cell survival and osteogenesis. This study evaluates the printability, physical properties, biocompatibility, and osteogenic potential of four commonly used alginate-based bioinks and establishes the importance of bioink properties for advancing toward the clinical translation of 3D bioprinted bone grafts.

33186924	Despite its simplicity, which makes it the most commonly used bioprinting method today, extrusion-based bioprinting suffers from its inability to reproduce the complex tissue architecture found in organs. Generally, this printing method allows for the dispensing of solutions of a predefined cell concentration through a rudimentary needle. Moreover, to avoid cell lysis in the dispensing needle, which is detrimental to the viability of the printed tissue, as well as cell loss in dead volumes of tubing, thereby increasing the cost of printing tissue, a common strategy has been to print with cell concentrations much lower in comparison to the concentrations found in living tissues. As a result, cell-to-cell distance is increased in the dispensed samples impairing communication through cytokines. Here, we present a microfluidic-based print head capable of modulating the printed cell concentration in real-time. This device allows bioprinting at high cell concentrations by concentrating and dispensing fibroblasts at concentrations up to 10 million cells∙mL-1. We also demonstrate that this device can be used to print bladder organoids. As the cell seeding concentration is of major importance for organogenesis in 3D culture, organoid printing allows the user to standardize the process of organoid formation and achieve more reliable and reproducible results.

32995675	The incorporation of hydroxyapatite (HAP) into poly-l-lactic acid (PLLA) matrix serving as bone scaffold is expected to exhibit bioactivity and osteoconductivity to those of the living bone. While too low degradation rate of HAP/PLLA scaffold hinders the activity because the embedded HAP in the PLLA matrix is difficult to contact and exchange ions with body fluid. In this study, biodegradable polymer poly (glycolic acid) (PGA) was blended into the HAP/PLLA scaffold fabricated by laser 3D printing to accelerate the degradation. The results indicated that the incorporation of PGA enhanced the degradation rate of scaffold as indicated by the weight loss increasing from 3.3% to 25.0% after immersion for 28 days, owing to the degradation of high hydrophilic PGA and the subsequent accelerated hydrolysis of PLLA chains. Moreover, a lot of pores produced by the degradation of the scaffold promoted the exposure of HAP from the matrix, which not only activated the deposition of bone like apatite on scaffold but also accelerated apatite growth. Cytocompatibility tests exhibited a good osteoblast adhesion, spreading and proliferation, suggesting the scaffold provided a suitable environment for cell cultivation. Furthermore, the scaffold displayed excellent bone defect repair capacity with the formation of abundant new bone tissue and blood vessel tissue, and both ends of defect region were bridged after 8 weeks of implantation.

32907514	Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disorder in which the body's own immune system selectively attacks beta cells within pancreatic islets resulting in insufficient insulin production and loss of the ability to regulate blood glucose (BG) levels. Currently, the standard of care consists of BG level monitoring and insulin administration, which are essential to avoid the consequences of dysglycemia and long-term complications. Although recent advances in continuous glucose monitoring and automated insulin delivery systems have resulted in improved clinical outcomes for users, nearly 80% of people with T1D fail to achieve their target hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels defined by the American Diabetes Association. Intraportal islet transplantation into immunosuppressed individuals with T1D suffering from impaired awareness of hypoglycemia has resulted in lower HbA1c, elimination of severe hypoglycemic events, and insulin independence, demonstrating the unique potential of beta cell replacement therapy (BCRT) in providing optimal glycemic control and a functional cure for T1D. BCRTs need to maximize cell engraftment, long-term survival, and function in the absence of immunosuppression to provide meaningful clinical outcomes to all people living with T1D. One innovative technology that could enable widespread translation of this approach into the clinic is three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting. Herein, we review how bioprinting could facilitate translation of BCRTs as well as the current and forthcoming techniques used for bioprinting of a BCRT product. We discuss the strengths and weaknesses of 3D bioprinting in this context in addition to the road ahead for the development of BCRTs. Impact statement Significant research developments in beta cell replacement therapies show its promise in providing a functional cure for type 1 diabetes (T1D); yet, their widespread clinical use has been difficult to achieve. This review provides a brief overview of the requirements for a beta cell replacement product followed by a discussion on both the promise and limitations of three-dimensional bioprinting in facilitating the fabrication of such products to enable translation into the clinic. Advancements in this area could be a key component to unlocking the safety and effectiveness of beta cell therapy for T1D.	3D Bioprinting and Translation of Beta Cell Replacement Therapies for Type 1 Diabetes.	2021	Jun	Gurlin Rachel E;Giraldo Jaime A;Latres Esther	3D printing;beta cell replacement therapy;bioprinting;type 1 diabetes	Bioprinting;Blood Glucose;Blood Glucose Self-Monitoring;Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1;Humans;Islets of Langerhans Transplantation	Tissue engineering.

32902201	The field of 3D printing is an area of active research, with a substantial focus given to the design and construction of customized tools for applications in technology. There exists a particular need in these developing areas of opportunity for new multi-functional soft materials that are biologically compatible for the growth and directed culturing of cells. Herein, a composite material consisting of gold nanoparticles with useful plasmonic properties embedded within a highly hydrophilic poly-2-hydroxyethylmethacrylate matrix is described and characterized. This composite material serves dual functions as both host framework scaffold for cell lines such as pre-osteoblasts as well as a plasmonic biosensor for in situ measurements of living cells. The plasmonic properties of this system are characterized as a function of the material properties and related to compositional features of the material through a proposed light-directed mechanism. This chemistry provides a tunable, 3D printable plasmonic composite material of encapsulated gold nanoparticles in a biologically-compliant, acrylate-based hydrogel matrix.

32840820	"Bioprinting has emerged as a promising method for precise spatiotemporal patterning of biological materials such as living cells, genetic materials, and proteins, which are sensitive to any other fabrication techniques. Bioprinting allows the generation of tissue constructs and models that closely mimic the anatomical and physiological attributes of a chosen tissue. In vitro toxicology assays can greatly benefit from bioprinting as drugs can be screened with higher efficiencies in a significantly reduced period. This protocol describes a method for fabricating bioprinted cartilage constructs which can be used for in vitro toxicology studies employing a scalable ""tissue strand"" bioprinting modality."

32840819	Functional vasculature is crucial for the maintenance of living tissues via the transport of oxygen, nutrients, and metabolic waste products. As a result, insufficient vascularization in thick engineered tissues will lead to cell death and necrosis due to mass transport and diffusional constraints. To circumvent these limitations, we describe the development of a microscale continuous optical bioprinting (μCOB) platform for 3D printing complex vascularized tissues with superior resolution and speed. By using the μCOB system, endothelial cells and other supportive cells can be printed directly into hydrogels with precisely controlled distribution and subsequent formation of lumen-like structures in vitro.

32840809	Thanks to their unique advantages, additive manufacturing technologies are revolutionizing almost all sectors of the industrial and academic worlds, including tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. In particular, 3D bioprinting is rapidly emerging as a first-choice approach for the fabrication-in one step-of advanced cell-laden hydrogel constructs to be used for in vitro and in vivo studies. This technique consists in the precise deposition layer-by-layer of sub-millimetric hydrogel strands in which living cells are embedded. A key factor of this process consists in the proper formulation of the hydrogel precursor solution, the so-called bioink. Ideal bioinks should be able, on the one side, to support cell growth and differentiation and, on the other, to allow the high-resolution deposition of cell-laden hydrogel strands. The latter feature requires the extruded solution to instantaneously undergo a sol-gel transition to avoid its collapse after deposition.To address this challenge, researchers are recently focusing their attention on the synthesis of several derivatives of natural biopolymers to enhance their printability. Here, we present an approach for the synthesis of photocurable derivatives of natural biopolymers-namely, gelatin methacrylate, hyaluronic acid methacrylate, chondroitin sulfate methacrylate, and PEGylated fibrinogen-that can be used to formulate tailored innovative bioinks for coaxial-based 3D bioprinting applications.

32748107	Many techniques for engineering and interrogating three-dimensional (3-D) muscle bundles from animal- or patient-derived myoblasts have recently been developed to overcome the limitations of existing in vitro and in vivo model systems. However, many approaches for engineering 3-D muscle bundles rely on specialized and time-consuming techniques, such as photolithography for fabrication and cryosectioning for histology. Cryosectioning also limits visualization to a single plane instead of the entire 3-D structure. To address these challenges, we first implemented a consumer-grade 3-D-printer to rapidly prototype multiple templates for engineering muscle bundles. We then employed our templates to engineer 3D muscle bundles and identify template geometries that promoted bundle survival over three weeks. Subsequently, we implemented tissue clearing, immunostaining, and confocal imaging to acquire z-stacks of intact muscle bundles labelled for myogenic markers. With this approach, we could select the imaging plane on-demand and visualize the intact 3-D structure of bundles. However, tissue clearing did cause some tissue degradation that should be considered. Together, these advances in muscle tissue engineering and imaging will accelerate the use of these 3-D tissue platforms for disease modeling and therapeutic discovery.

32640425	As a projection based three-dimensional printing method, digital light processing bioprinting (DLPBP) has higher printing resolution and is suitable for constructing finer structures to mimic tissues when compared to extrusion based bioprinting. However, there is a lack of understanding about printing behavior during DLPBP. Herein, a photo crosslinking theory for ink was established and a specified amount of light absorber was added to control crosslinking depth. Then, a standardized methodology was established to quantitatively evaluate printing resolution using different parameters. Complex biostructures, such as the ear, hand, and heart, were precisely printed after understanding the mechanism. Additionally, the mechanical properties of printed samples were accurately adjusted by changing the hydrogel concentration, as well as the degree of substitution and photocrosslinking time. The tissue types printed were from ultra-soft tissues, such as liver (6-8 kPa) to soft tissue, such as the skin (0.3-0.4 MPa). A branching vessel with cells in a real tensile modulus was printed as a demonstration. After 1 week of culture, proliferation and function of human umbilical vein endothelial cells were characterized. Overall, we made it possible to print a mimic complex tissue with high precision, required physical properties and functionalized living cells.

31237803	Commercially available assistive devices (AD) may not always match the individual needs of the patient. Sometimes substantial customizations or a new design is needed. New ideas, arising by involving the patient, could help many, but product development and marketing is hard. We hypothesize that digital fabrication (DF), e.g. 3D printing, may be an opportunity to involve patients in the process of custom design and creation of personalized ADs. As DF is minimizing the requirement for manual activities, DF has the potential to enable people in creating ADs for personal use, despite physical limitations. However, co-design and the use of DF in AD provision is still in its infancy and scarcely reported in scientific literature. We studied the literature, performed a mini survey and then conducted a case story of a person with severe upper extremity impairment who became a maker of her personal AD using 3D printing. Implications of using DF as a key enabling technology empowering patients with physical limits to become active in personal AD provision are discussed. We conclude that this topic merits a proper scientific investigation of systematically engaging patients as competent participants in the development and realization of assistive devices and technologies.

37779922	Recent advances in materials science and engineering highlight the importance of designing sophisticated biomaterials with well-defined architectures and tunable properties for emerging biomedical applications. Click chemistry, a powerful method allowing specific and controllable bioorthogonal reactions, has revolutionized our ability to make complex molecular structures with a high level of specificity, selectivity, and yield under mild conditions. These features combined with minimal byproduct formation have enabled the design of a wide range of macromolecular architectures from quick and versatile click reactions. Furthermore, copper-free click chemistry has resulted in a change of paradigm, allowing researchers to perform highly selective chemical reactions in biological environments to further understand the structure and function of cells. In living systems, introducing clickable groups into biomolecules such as polysaccharides (PSA) has been explored as a general approach to conduct medicinal chemistry and potentially help solve healthcare needs. De novo biosynthetic pathways for chemical synthesis have also been exploited and optimized to perform PSA-based bioconjugation inside living cells without interfering with their native processes or functions. This strategy obviates the need for laborious and costly chemical reactions which normally require extensive and time-consuming purification steps. Using these approaches, various PSA-based macromolecules have been manufactured as building blocks for the design of novel biomaterials. Clickable PSA provides a powerful and versatile toolbox for biomaterials scientists and will increasingly play a crucial role in the biomedical field. Specifically, bioclick reactions with PSA have been leveraged for the design of advanced drug delivery systems and minimally invasive injectable hydrogels. In this review article, we have outlined the key aspects and breadth of PSA-derived bioclick reactions as a powerful and versatile toolbox to design advanced polymeric biomaterials for biomedical applications such as molecular imaging, drug delivery, and tissue engineering. Additionally, we have also discussed the past achievements, present developments, and recent trends of clickable PSA-based biomaterials such as 3D printing, as well as their challenges, clinical translatability, and future perspectives.

36844245	212Three-dimensional (3D) printing is a modern, computer-aided, design-based technology that allows the layer-by-layer deposition of 3D structures. Bioprinting, a 3D printing technology, has attracted increasing attention because of its capacity to produce scaffolds for living cells with extreme precision. Along with the rapid development of 3D bioprinting technology, the innovation of bio-inks, which is recognized as the most challenging aspect of this technology, has demonstrated tremendous promise for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Cellulose is the most abundant polymer in nature. Various forms of cellulose, nanocellulose, and cellulose derivatives, including cellulose ethers and cellulose esters, are common bioprintable materials used to develop bio-inks in recent years, owing to their biocompatibility, biodegradability, low cost, and printability. Although various cellulose-based bio-inks have been investigated, the potential applications of nanocellulose and cellulose derivative-based bio-inks have not been fully explored. This review focuses on the physicochemical properties of nanocellulose and cellulose derivatives as well as the recent advances in bio-ink design for 3D bioprinting of bone and cartilage. In addition, the current advantages and disadvantages of these bio-inks and their prospects in 3D printing-based tissue engineering are comprehensively discussed. We hope to offer helpful information for the logical design of innovative cellulose-based materials for use in this sector in the future.

36636132	In situ bioprinting has emerged as a promising technology for tissue and organ engineering based on the precise positioning of living cells, growth factors, and biomaterials. Rather than traditional in vitro reconstruction and recapitulation of tissue or organ models, the in situ technology can directly print on specific anatomical positions in living bodies. The requirements for biological activity, function, and mechanical property in an in vivo setting are more complex. By combining progressive innovations of biomaterials, tissue engineering, and digitalization, especially robotics, in situ bioprinting has gained significant interest from the academia and industry, demonstrating its prospect for clinical studies. This article reviews the progress of in situ bioprinting, with an emphasis on robotic-assisted studies. The main modalities for in situ three-dimensional bioprinting, which include extrusion-based printing, inkjet printing, laser-based printing, and their derivatives, are briefly introduced. These modalities have been integrated with various custom-tailored printers (i.e., end effectors) mounted on robotic arms for dexterous and precision biofabrication. The typical prototypes based on various robot configurations, including Cartesian, articulated, and parallel mechanisms, for in situ bioprinting are discussed and compared. The conventional and most recent applications of robotic-assisted methods for in situ fabrication of tissue and organ models, including cartilage, bone, and skin, are also elucidated, followed by a discussion on the existing challenges in this field with their corresponding suggestions.

36618954	The outburst of the fourth Industrial Revolution had a significant impact on many aspects of life. The discovery of new technologies in medicine has resulted in innovations: organ transplants. The introduction of three-dimensional (3D) organ printing technology promises improvements to the field. Organs such as the liver, kidneys, heart and others are printed to meet the needs of the actual organs. However, the production of prototype organs to replace the original organs is associated with the issue of changing the creation of Allah. Accordingly, this study will analyse the issue of changing the creation of God in three-dimensional (3D) organ printing technology according to the perspective of Islamic law. Several appropriate methodologies in Islamic law (usul fiqh) are used such as legal reasoning through maqasid shariah perspective and analogical reasoning. The result shows that three-dimensional (3D) organ printing technology falls under the permissible category of changing the creation of Allah because it can save human lives. The production of organs through 3D printing involving changes included in the category of necessity (daruri) and need (hajiy) is permissible, but the category of desirable (tahsini) requires further specifications.

36585374	Embedded 3D bioprinting has great value for the freeform fabrication of living matter. However, embedded 3D bioprinting is currently limited to highly viscous liquid baths or liquid-like solid baths. In contrast, prior to crosslinking, most hydrogels are formulated as low-viscosity solutions and are therefore not directly compatible with bioprinting due to low shape fidelity and poor print stability. The authors here present a method to enable low-viscosity ink 3D (LoV3D) bioprinting, based on aqueous two-phase stabilization of the ink-bath interface. LoV3D allows for the printing of living constructs at high extrusion speeds (up to 1.8 m s-1 ) with high viability due to its exceedingly low-viscosity. Moreover, LoV3D liquid/liquid interfaces offer unique advantages for fusing printed structures, creating intricate vasculature, and modifying surfaces at higher efficiencies than traditional systems. Furthermore, the low interfacial tension of LoV3D bioprinting offers unprecedented nozzle-independent control over filament diameter via large-dimension strand-thinning, which allows for the printing of an exceptionally wide range of diameters down to the width of a single cell. Overall, LoV3D bioprinting is a unique all-aqueous approach with broad material compatibility without the need for rheological ink adaption, which opens new avenues of application in cell patterning, drug screening, engineered meat, and organ fabrication.

36583240	Tissue engineering offers a great potential in regenerative dentistry and to this end, three dimensional (3D) bioprinting has been emerging nowadays to enable the incorporation of living cells into the biomaterials (such a mixture is referred as a bioink in the literature) to create scaffolds. However, the bioinks available for scaffold bioprinting are limited, particularly for dental tissue engineering, due to the complicated, yet compromised, printability, mechanical and biological properties simultaneously imposed on the bioinks. This paper presents our study on the development of a novel bioink from carboxymethyl chitosan (CMC) and alginate (Alg) for bioprinting scaffolds for enamel tissue regeneration. CMC was used due to its antibacterial ability and superior cell interaction properties, while Alg was added to enhance the printability and mechanical properties as well as to regulate the degradation rate. The bioinks with three mixture ratios of Alg and CMC (2-4, 3-3 and 4-2) were prepared, and then printed into the calcium chloride crosslinker solution (100 mM) to form a 3D structure of scaffolds. The printed scaffolds were characterized in terms of structural, swelling, degradation, and mechanical properties, followed by theirin vitrocharacterization for enamel tissue regeneration. The results showed that the bioinks with higher concentrations of Alg were more viscous and needed higher pressure for printing; while the printed scaffolds were highly porous and showed a high degree of printability and structural integrity. The hydrogels with higher CMC ratios had higher swelling ratios, faster degradation rates, and lower compressive modulus. Dental epithelial cell line, HAT-7, could maintain high viability in the printed constructs after 1, 7 and 14 d of culture. HAT-7 cells were also able to maintain their morphology and secrete alkaline phosphatase after 14 d of culture in the 3D printed scaffolds, suggesting the capacity of these cells for mineral deposition and enamel-like tissue formation. Among all combinations Alg4%-CMC2% and in a less degree 2%Alg-4%CMC showed the higher potential to promote ameloblast differentiation, Ca and P deposition and matrix mineralizationin vitro. Taken together, Alg-CMC has been illustrated to be suitable to print scaffolds with dental epithelial cells for enamel tissue regeneration.

36582305	3D bioprinting or additive manufacturing is an emerging innovative technology revolutionizing the field of biomedical applications by combining engineering, manufacturing, art, education, and medicine. This process involved incorporating the cells with biocompatible materials to design the required tissue or organ model in situ for various in vivo applications. Conventional 3D printing is involved in constructing the model without incorporating any living components, thereby limiting its use in several recent biological applications. However, this uses additional biological complexities, including material choice, cell types, and their growth and differentiation factors. This state-of-the-art technology consciously summarizes different methods used in bioprinting and their importance and setbacks. It also elaborates on the concept of bioinks and their utility. Biomedical applications such as cancer therapy, tissue engineering, bone regeneration, and wound healing involving 3D printing have gained much attention in recent years. This article aims to provide a comprehensive review of all the aspects associated with 3D bioprinting, from material selection, technology, and fabrication to applications in the biomedical fields. Attempts have been made to highlight each element in detail, along with the associated available reports from recent literature.

36551101	Organs-on-chips (OoCs) are microfluidic devices that contain bioengineered tissues or parts of natural tissues or organs and can mimic the crucial structures and functions of living organisms. They are designed to control and maintain the cell- and tissue-specific microenvironment while also providing detailed feedback about the activities that are taking place. Bioprinting is an emerging technology for constructing artificial tissues or organ constructs by combining state-of-the-art 3D printing methods with biomaterials. The utilization of 3D bioprinting and cells patterning in OoC technologies reinforces the creation of more complex structures that can imitate the functions of a living organism in a more precise way.

36550372	Biological living materials, such as animal bones and plant stems, are able to self-heal, regenerate, adapt and make decisions under environmental pressures. Despite recent successful efforts to imbue synthetic materials with some of these remarkable functionalities, many emerging properties of complex adaptive systems found in biology remain unexplored in engineered living materials. Here, we describe a three-dimensional printing approach that harnesses the emerging properties of fungal mycelia to create living complex materials that self-repair, regenerate and adapt to the environment while fulfilling an engineering function. Hydrogels loaded with the fungus Ganoderma lucidum are three-dimensionally printed into lattice architectures to enable mycelial growth in a balanced exploration and exploitation pattern that simultaneously promotes colonization of the gel and bridging of air gaps. To illustrate the potential of such mycelium-based living complex materials, we three-dimensionally print a robotic skin that is mechanically robust, self-cleaning and able to autonomously regenerate after damage.

36524860	Supramolecular hydrogels are of great interest in tissue scaffolding, diagnostics, and drug delivery due to their biocompatibility and stimuli-responsive properties. In particular, nucleosides are promising candidates as building blocks due to their manifold noncovalent interactions and ease of chemical modification. Significant progress in the field has been made over recent years to allow the use of nucleoside-based supramolecular hydrogels in the biomedical field, namely drug delivery and 3D bioprinting. For example, their long-term stability, printability, functionality, and bioactivity have been greatly improved by employing more than one gelator, incorporating different cations, including silver for antibacterial activity, or using additives such as boric acid or even biomolecules. This now permits their use as bioinks for 3D printing to produce cell-laden scaffolds with specified geometries and pore sizes as well as a homogeneous distribution of living cells and bioactive molecules. We have summarized the latest advances in nucleoside-based supramolecular hydrogels. Additionally, we discuss their synthesis, structural properties, and potential applications in tissue engineering and provide an outlook and future perspective on ongoing developments in the field.

36522661	Three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting fabricates 3D functional tissues/organs by accurately depositing the bioink composed of the biological materials and living cells. Even though 3D bioprinting techniques have experienced significant advancement over the past decades, it remains challenging for 3D bioprinting to artificially fabricate functional tissues/organs with high post-printing cell viability and functionality since cells endure various types of stress during the bioprinting process. Generally, cell viability which is affected by several factors including the stress and the environmental factors, such as pH and temperature, is mainly determined by the magnitude and duration of the stress imposed on the cells with poorer cell viability under a higher stress and a longer duration condition. The maintenance of high cell viability especially for those vulnerable cells, such as stem cells which are more sensitive to multiple stresses, is a key initial step to ensure the functionality of the artificial tissues/organs. In addition, maintaining the pluripotency of the cells such as proliferation and differentiation abilities is also essential for the 3D-bioprinted tissues/organs to be similar to native tissues/organs. This review discusses various pathways triggering cell damage and the major factors affecting cell viability during different bioprinting processes, summarizes the studies on cell viabilities and functionalities in different bioprinting processes, and presents several potential approaches to protect cells from injuries to ensure high cell viability and functionality.

36520018	Probiotic cellulose (PC), a living material (LM) consisting of probiotics integrated into bacterial cellulose, is the first example where life (probiotic proliferation) is the input to tune the viscoelasticity of the biomaterial. The gradual proliferation of probiotics within the matrix acts as a key modulator of the cellulose viscoelasticity, providing from celluloses with lower-than-matrix viscoelasticity to celluloses with viscoelastic moduli closer to those of elastic solids. This concept is a promising approach to producing living bio-ink with tunable viscoelastic response of special interest for specific applications such as 3D printing. In contrast to the most common hydrogels with stimuli-tunable mechanical properties, which require external stimuli such as mechanical stress, UV radiation, or heat, this living bio-ink only requires time to tune from a fluid-like into a solid-like biomaterial.

36511313	3D printing has emerged as a powerful way to produce complex materials on-demand. These printing technologies are now being applied in microbiology, with many recent examples where microbes and matrices are co-printed to create bespoke living materials. Here, we propose a new paradigm for microbial printing. In addition to its importance for materials, we argue that printing can be used to understand and engineer microbiome communities, analogous to its use in human tissue engineering. Many microbes naturally live in diverse, spatially structured communities that are challenging to study and manipulate. 3D printing offers an exciting new solution to these challenges, as it can precisely arrange microbes in 3D space, allowing one to build custom microbial communities for a wide range of purposes in research, medicine, and industry.	3D printing of microbial communities: A new platform for understanding and engineering microbiomes.	2023	Mar	Krishna Kumar Ravinash;Foster Kevin R		Humans;Tissue Engineering;Printing, Three-Dimensional;Microbiota	Microbial biotechnology	Centre for Bioengineering, School of Engineering and Materials Science, Queen Mary University of London, London, UK.;Department of Chemistry, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.;Department of Biochemistry, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.;Department of Biology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.

36466359	"Objective: The aim of tissue engineering (TE) is to replace the damaged tissues or failed organs, or restore their missing functions. The important means to achieve this aim is to integrate biomaterials and life elements. Hydrogels are very attractive biomaterials in the field of TE. In particular, engineering extracellular matrices (ECMs) formed by photosensitive hydrogels have captivated much attention, because photopolymerization has many advantages over traditional polymerization approaches, such as rapidity of reaction, spatiotemporal controllability of polymerization process, and operability at physiological temperature, especially it can realize the fabrications of engineering ECMs in the presence of living cells. There have been many excellent reviews on the applications of photosensitive hydrogels in TE in recent years, however, it is inevitable that researchers may have left out many important facts due to exploring the literature from one or a few aspects. It is also a great challenge for researchers to explore the internal relationships among countries, institutions, authors, and references from a large number of literatures in related fields. Therefore, bibliometrics may be a powerful tool to solve the above problems. A bibliometric and visualized analysis of publications concerning the photosensitive hydrogels for TE applications was performed, and the knowledge domain, research hotspots and frontiers in this topic were identified according to the analysis results. Methods: We identified and retrieved the publications regarding the photosensitive hydrogels for TE applications between 1996 and 2022 from Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC). Bibliometric and visualized analysis employing CiteSpace software and R-language package Bibliometrix were performed in this study. Results: 778 publications meeting the eligibility criteria were identified and retrieved from WoSCC. Among those, 2844 authors worldwide participated in the studies in this field, accompanied by an average annual article growth rate of 15.35%. The articles were co-authored by 800 institutions from 46 countries/regions, and the United States published the most, followed by China and South Korea. As the two countries that published the most papers, the United States and China could further strengthen cooperation in this field. Univ Colorado published the most articles (n = 150), accounting for 19.28% of the total. The articles were distributed in 112 journals, among which Biomaterials (n = 66) published the most articles, followed by Acta Biomaterialia (n = 54) and Journal of Biomedical Materials Research Part A (n = 42). The top 10 journals published 47.8% of the 778 articles. The most prolific author was Anseth K (n = 33), followed by Khademhosseini A (n = 29) and Bryant S (n = 22). A total of 1443 keywords were extracted from the 778 articles and the keyword with the highest centrality was ""extracellular matrix"" (centrality: 0.12). The keywords appeared recently with strong citation bursts were ""gelatin"", ""3d printing"" and ""3d bioprinting"", representing the current research hotspots in this field. ""Gelma"", ""3d printing"" and ""thiol-ene"" were the research frontiers in recent years. Conclusion: This bibliometric and visualized study offered a comprehensive understanding of publications regarding the photosensitive hydrogels for TE applications from 1996 to 2022, including the knowledge domain, research hotspots and frontiers in this filed. The outcome of this study would provide insights for scholars in the related research filed."

36444840	Living materials with embedded microorganisms can genetically encode attractive sensing, self-repairing, and responsive functionalities for applications in medicine, robotics, and infrastructure. While the synthetic toolbox for genetically engineering bacteria continues to expand, technologies to shape bacteria-laden living materials into complex 3D geometries are still rather limited. Here, it is shown that bacteria-laden hydrogels can be shaped into living materials with unusual architectures and functionalities using readily available light-based printing techniques.

36439379	Three-dimensional bioprinting is a promising field in regenerating patient-specific tissues and organs due to its inherent capability of releasing biocompatible materials encapsulating living cells in a predefined location. Due to the diverse characteristics of tissues and organs in terms of microstructures and cell types, a multinozzle extrusion-based 3D bioprinting system has gained popularity. The investigations on interactions between various biomaterials and cell-to-material can provide relevant information about the scaffold geometry, cell viability, and proliferation. Natural hydrogels are frequently used in bioprinting materials because of their high-water content and biocompatibility. However, the dominancy of liquid characteristics of only-hydrogel materials makes the printing process challenging. Polycaprolactone (PCL) is the most frequently used synthetic biopolymer. It can provide mechanical integrity to achieve dimensionally accurate fabricated scaffolds, especially for hard tissues such as bone and cartilage scaffolds. In this paper, we explored various multimaterial bioprinting strategies with our recently proposed bio-inks and PCL intending to achieve dimensional accuracy and mechanical aspects. Various strategies were followed to coprint natural and synthetic biopolymers and interactions were analyzed between them. Printability of pure PCL with various molecular weights was optimized with respect to different process parameters such as nozzle temperature, printing pressure, printing speed, porosity, and bed temperature to coprint with natural hydrogels. The relationship between the rheological properties and shape fidelity of natural polymers was investigated with a set of printing strategies during coprinting with PCL. The successful application of this research can help achieve dimensionally accurate scaffolds.

36433057	In this paper, the fatigue behavior of polylactic acid (PLA) material with bamboo filler printed by 3D additive printing using fused deposition modelling (FDM) technology at different infill densities and print nozzle diameters is investigated. The mechanical test results are supported by the findings from SEM image analysis. The fatigue behavior was tested at four consecutive 250 cycles at loads ranging from 5 to 20, 30, 40, and 50% based on the limits found in the static tensile test. The results of the static tensile and low-cycle fatigue tests confirmed significant effects of infill density of 60%, 80%, and 100% on the tensile strength of the tested specimens. In particular, the research results show a significant effect of infill density on the fatigue properties of the tested materials. The influence of cyclic tests resulted in the strengthening of the tested material, and at the same time, its viscoelastic behavior was manifested. SEM analysis of the fracture surface confirmed a good interaction between the PLA matrix and the bamboo-based filler using nozzle diameters of 0.4 and 0.6 mm and infill densities of 60%, 80%, and 100%. Low-cycle testing showed no reductions in the mechanical properties and fatigue lives of the 3D printed samples.

36430922	Bionic-engineered tissues have been proposed for testing the performance of cardiovascular medical devices and predicting clinical outcomes ex vivo. Progress has been made in the development of compliant electronics that are capable of monitoring treatment parameters and being coupled to engineered tissues; however, the scale of most engineered tissues is too small to accommodate the size of clinical-grade medical devices. Here, we show substantial progress toward bionic tissues for evaluating cardiac ablation tools by generating a centimeter-scale human cardiac disk and coupling it to a hydrogel-based soft-pressure sensor. The cardiac tissue with contiguous electromechanical function was made possible by our recently established method to 3D bioprint human pluripotent stem cells in an extracellular matrix-based bioink that allows for in situ cell expansion prior to cardiac differentiation. The pressure sensor described here utilized electrical impedance tomography to enable the real-time spatiotemporal mapping of pressure distribution. A cryoablation tip catheter was applied to the composite bionic tissues with varied pressure. We found a close correlation between the cell response to ablation and the applied pressure. Under some conditions, cardiomyocytes could survive in the ablated region with more rounded morphology compared to the unablated controls, and connectivity was disrupted. This is the first known functional characterization of living human cardiomyocytes following an ablation procedure that suggests several mechanisms by which arrhythmia might redevelop following an ablation. Thus, bionic-engineered testbeds of this type can be indicators of tissue health and function and provide unique insight into human cell responses to ablative interventions.

36404789	Three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting offers a potentially powerful new approach to reverse engineering human pathophysiology to address the problem of developing more biomimetic experimental systems. Human tissues and organs are multiscale and multi-material structures. The greatest challenge for organ printing is the complexity of the structural elements, from the shape of the macroscopic structure to the details of the nanostructure. A highly bionic tissue-organ model requires the use of multiple printing processes. Some printers with multiple nozzles and multiple processes are currently reported. However, the bulk volume, which is inconvenient to move, and the high cost of these printing systems limits the expansion of their applications. Scientists urgently need a multifunctional miniaturized 3D bioprinter. In this study, a portable multifunctional 3D bioprinting system was built based on a modular design and a custom written operating application. Using this platform, constructs with detailed surface structures, hollow structures, and multiscale complex tissue analogs were successfully printed using commercial polymers and a series of hydrogel-based inks. With further development, this portable, modular, low-cost, and easy-to-use Bluetooth-enabled 3D printer promises exciting opportunities for resource-constrained application scenarios, not only in biomedical engineering but also in the education field, and may be used in space experiments.

36404779	As a major extracellular matrix component within the skin, collagen has been widely used to engineer human skin tissues. However, most collagen is extracted from animals. Here, we introduced recombinant human type III collagen (rhCol3) as a bioactive component to formulate bioinks for the bioprinting of a full-thickness human skin equivalent. Human dermal fibroblasts were encapsulated in the gelatin methacryloyl-rhCol3 composite bioinks and printed on a transwell to form the dermis layer, on which human epidermal keratinocytes were seeded to perform an air-liquid interface culture for 6 weeks. After optimizing the bioink formulation and bioprinting process, we investigated the effect of rhCol3 on skin tissue formation. The results suggest that a higher concentration of rhCol3 would enhance the growth of both cells, resulting in a more confluent (~100%) spreading of the epidermal keratinocytes at an early stage (3 days), compared to the rhCol3-free counterpart. Moreover, in an in vivo experiment, adding rhCol3 in the hydrogel formulation would contribute to the skin wound healing process. Taken together, we conclude that rhCol3 could act as a functional bioink component to promote basic skin cellular processes for skin tissue engineering.

36404778	The application of three-dimensional (3D) printing has been increasing and we invented cost-effective and time-saving 3D printed model of intra-abdominal cavity which was utilized in liver transplantation (LT) to prevent large-for-size syndrome. 3D printings were performed on potential adult recipients with small cavity and pediatric patients scheduled for transplantation during July 2020 - September 2021. Based on the computed tomography of the recipient, the inner surface of the abdominal cavity was outlined. The line was marked with a distance of 1 - 3 cm. Then, the outlined data were reconstructed as a 3D model and printed by a fused deposition modeling type 3D printer with a thickness of 2 mm. Pillars and footings for holding the lines were printed and assembled altogether. During deceased donor organ procurement, the size of the graft was compared to that of the printed model. For living donor LT, preoperatively planned liver graft was printed and was physically placed into the 3D printed abdominal cavity. All the 16 cases with 3D printed abdominal cavity showed appropriate fitting of the donor's liver graft to both the 3D printed model and actual recipient's abdominal cavity with no large-for-size syndrome after LT. Median time for manufacturing the model was 576 min (IQR 434 - 680) and estimated median cost for the filament was US$ 1.6 (IQR 1.2 - 1.7). The 3D printed abdominal cavity model can be manufactured in <10 h and was useful for preventing large-for-size syndrome in small-sized recipients.	3D Printing Model of Abdominal Cavity of Liver Transplantation Recipient to Prevent Large-for-Size Syndrome.	2022		Park Sunghae;Choi Gyu-Seong;Kim Jong Man;Lee Sanghoon;Joh Jae-Won;Rhu Jinsoo	3D printer;3D printing;Large-for-size syndrome;Liver transplantation		International journal of bioprinting	Department of Surgery, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.;Department of Surgery, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.;Department of Surgery, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.;Department of Surgery, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.;Department of Surgery, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.;Department of Surgery, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.

36401767	Cardiovascular disease is one of the main diseases that endanger human life and health, and heart failure often occurs when the cardiovascular disease develops to the end-stage. Heart transplantation is the most effective treatment. However, there has always been a shortage of living heart organs. With the development of regenerative medicine, researchers have turned to bioprinting technology that can build tissues and organs in vitro. A large number of relevant literature on three-dimensional (3D) bioprinted hearts were searched and screened in Google Scholar. 3D bioprinting technology can accurately print biomaterials containing living cells into 3D functional living tissues, providing a feasible solution to the shortage of transplantable organs. As one of the most important organs in the human body, the research on 3D bioprinting of the heart has currently become a hot topic. This paper briefly overviews 3D bioprinting technology and the progress in bioprinting cardiac tissue. It is believed that in the future, bio-printed hearts will become a reality, making a new way of providing artificial organs for heart transplantation.

36395510	3D bioprinting technology has gained increased attention in the regenerative medicine and tissue engineering communities over the past decade with their attempts to create functional living tissues and organsde novo. While tissues such as skin, bone, and cartilage have been successfully fabricated using 3D bioprinting, there are still many technical and process driven challenges that must be overcome before a complete tissue engineered solution is realized. Although there may never be a single adopted bioprinting process in the scientific community, adherence to optimized bioprinting protocols could reduce variability and improve precision with the goal of ensuring high quality printed constructs. Here, we report on the bioprinting of a gelatin-alginate-collagen bioink containing human mesenchymal stromal cells (hMSCs) which has been optimized to ensure printing consistency and reliability. The study consists of three phases: a pre-printing phase which focuses on bioink characterization; a printing phase which focuses on bioink extrudability/printability, construct stability, and printing accuracy; and a post-processing phase which focuses on the homogeneity and bioactivity of the encapsulated hMSC printed constructs. The results showed that eight identical constructs containing hMSCs could be reliably and accurately printed into stable cross-hatched structures with a single material preparation, and that batch-to-batch consistency was accurately maintained across all preparations. Analysis of the proliferation, morphology, and differentiation of encapsulated hMSCs within the printed constructs showed that cells were able to form large,interconnected colonies and were capable of robust adipogenic differentiation within 14 d of culturing.	3D bioprinting optimization of human mesenchymal stromal cell laden gelatin-alginate-collagen bioink.	2022	Dec	Sawyer Stephen W;Takeda Kazuyo;Alayoubi Alaadin;Mirdamadi Eman;Zidan Ahmed;Bauer Steven R;Degheidy Heba	3D printing;MSCs;bioink;bioprinting;cellular encapsulation;gelatin-alginate-collagen;human mesenchymal stromal cells	Humans;Gelatin;Alginates;Reproducibility of Results;Collagen;Mesenchymal Stem Cells	Biomedical materials (Bristol, England)	Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER), U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Silver Spring, MD, United States of America.;Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER), U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Silver Spring, MD, United States of America.;Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Silver Spring, MD, United States of America.;Department of Bioengineering, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, United States of America.;Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Silver Spring, MD, United States of America.;Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER), U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Silver Spring, MD, United States of America.;Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER), U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Silver Spring, MD, United States of America.

36373498	Tympanic membrane perforation is a common condition in clinical otolaryngology. Although some eardrum patients can self-heal, a long period of non-healing perforation leads to persistent otitis media, conductive deafness, and poor quality of life. Tympanic membrane repair with autologous materials requires a second incision, and the sampling site may get infected. It is challenging to repair tympanic membranes while maintaining high functionality, safety, affordability, and aesthetics. 3D bioprinting can be used to fabricate tissue patches with materials, factors, and cells in a design manner. This paper reviews 3D printing technology that is being used widely in recent years to construct eardrum stents and the utilized applied materials for tympanic membrane repair. The paper begins with an introduction of the physiological structure of the tympanic membrane, briefly reviews the current clinical method thereafter, highlights the recent 3D printing-related strategies in tympanic membrane repair, describes the materials and cells that might play an important role in 3D printing, and finally provides a perspective of this field.	3D printing technology and applied materials in eardrum regeneration.	2023	May	Hu Haolei;Chen Jianwei;Li Shuo;Xu Tao;Li Yi	3d printing;Tympanic membrane perforation;eardrum regeneration;materials; stem cells	Humans;Tympanic Membrane;Quality of Life;Tympanic Membrane Perforation;Printing, Three-Dimensional;Regeneration	Journal of biomaterials science.

36346873	Recapitulating inherent heterogeneity and complex microarchitectures within confined print volumes for developing implantable constructs that could maintain their structure in vivo has remained challenging. Here, we present a combinational multimaterial and embedded bioprinting approach to fabricate complex tissue constructs that can be implanted postprinting and retain their three-dimensional (3D) shape in vivo. The microfluidics-based single nozzle printhead with computer-controlled pneumatic pressure valves enables laminar flow-based voxelation of up to seven individual bioinks with rapid switching between various bioinks that can solve alignment issues generated during switching multiple nozzles. To improve the spatial organization of various bioinks, printing fidelity with the z-direction, and printing speed, self-healing and biodegradable colloidal gels as support baths are introduced to build complex geometries. Furthermore, the colloidal gels provide suitable microenvironments like native extracellular matrices (ECMs) for achieving cell growths and fast host cell invasion via interconnected microporous networks in vitro and in vivo. Multicompartment microfibers (i.e., solid, core-shell, or donut shape), composed of two different bioink fractions with various lengths or their intravolume space filled by two, four, and six bioink fractions, are successfully printed in the ECM-like support bath. We also print various acellular complex geometries such as pyramids, spirals, and perfusable branched/linear vessels. Successful fabrication of vascularized liver and skeletal muscle tissue constructs show albumin secretion and bundled muscle mimic fibers, respectively. The interconnected microporous networks of colloidal gels result in maintaining printed complex geometries while enabling rapid cell infiltration, in vivo.

36315932	The incorporation of living cells into materials promises both significant challenges and new possibilities. Although recent years have seen important advances in this field, there is still much to be learned about engineering interfaces between cells and materials. Here, we present a new class of 3D-printable materials, based on poly(N-hydroxymethylacrylamide) (PNHMAA), in which the spore-forming bacterium Bacillus subtilis is effectively cross-linked into the surrounding polymeric scaffold. After dehydration and subsequent re-swelling in nutrient-rich media, embedded cells and spores become metabolically active and are capable of heterologous protein production and secretion. Strikingly, the leak-free scaffold allows protein production while preventing escape of embedded cells. The successful construction of complex three-dimensional structures by stereolithographic printing of living PNHMAA composite materials suggests utility in a broad range of applications.	3D-Printable Cellular Composites for the Production of Recombinant Proteins.	2022	Nov	Sim Seunghyun;Hui Yue;Tirrell David A		Bacillus subtilis;Printing, Three-Dimensional;Recombinant Proteins	Biomacromolecules	Division of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, California 91125, United States.;Division of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, California 91125, United States.;Division of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, California 91125, United States.

36305041	Hydrogels hold much promise for 3D printing of functional living materials; however, challenges remain in tailoring mechanical robustness as well as biological performance. In addressing this challenge, the modular synthesis of functional hydrogels from 3-arm diblock copolypeptide stars composed of an inner poly(l-glutamate) domain and outer poly(l-tyrosine) or poly(l-valine) blocks is described. Physical crosslinking due to ß-sheet assembly of these star block copolymers gives mechanical stability during extrusion printing and the selective incorporation of methacrylate units allows for subsequent photocrosslinking to occur under biocompatible conditions. This permits direct ink writing (DIW) printing of bacteria-based mixtures leading to 3D objects with high fidelity and excellent bacterial viability. The tunable stiffness of different copolypeptide networks enables control over proliferation and colony formation for embedded Escherichia coli bacteria as demonstrated via isopropyl ß-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) induction of green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression. This translation of molecular structure to network properties highlights the versatility of these polypeptide hydrogel systems with the combination of writable structures and biological activity illustrating the future potential of these 3D-printed biocomposites.

36304899	Physical hydrogels prepared from natural biopolymers are the most popular components for bioinks. However, to improve the mechanical properties of the network, in particular its durability for long-lasting tissue engineering applications or its stiffness for bone/cartilage applications, covalent chemical hydrogels have to be considered. For that purpose, biorthogonal reactions are required to allow the inclusion of living cells within the bioink reservoir before the 3D printing procedure. Interestingly, such reactions also unlock the possibility to further multifunctionalize the network, adding bioactive moieties to tune the biological properties of the resulting printed biomaterial. Surprisingly, compared to the huge number of studies disclosing novel bioink compositions, no extensive efforts have been made by the scientific community to develop new chemical reactions meeting the requirements of both cell encapsulation, chemical orthogonality and versatile enough to be applied to a wide range of molecular components, including fragile biomolecules. That could be explained by the domination of acrylate photocrosslinking in the bioprinting field. On the other hand, proceeding chemoselectively and allowing the polymerization of any type of silylated molecules, the sol-gel inorganic polymerization was used as a crosslinking reaction to prepare hydrogels. Recent development of this strategy includes the optimization of biocompatible catalytic conditions and the silylation of highly attractive biomolecules such as amino acids, bioactive peptides, proteins and oligosaccharides. When one combines the simplicity and the versatility of the process, with the ease of functionalization of any type of relevant silylated molecules that can be combined in an infinite manner, it was obvious that a family of bioinks could emerge quickly. This review presents the sol-gel process in biocompatible conditions and the various classes of relevant silylated molecules that can be used as bioink components. The preparation of hydrogels and the kinetic considerations of the sol-gel chemistry which at least allowed cell encapsulation and extrusion-based bioprinting are discussed.

38069695	Living organisms frequently use structural color for coloration as an alternative mechanism to chemical pigmentation. Recently there has been a growing interest to translate structural color into synthetic materials as a more durable and less hazardous alternative to conventional pigments. Efforts to fabricate structurally colored materials take place in different fronts, from 3D printing to spray-coating and roll-to-roll casting. Stability, performance, and quality of the color, the environmental impact of the materials or their manufacturing methods are some of the heavily researched topics we discuss. First, we highlight recent examples of large-scale manufacturing technologies to fabricate structurally colored objects. Second, we discuss the current challenges to be tackled to create perfect appearances which aim at the full color gamut while caring for environmental concerns. Finally, we discuss possible scenarios that could be followed in order to involve other manufacturing methods for creating structurally colored objects.

36261395	"3D bioprinting holds great promise for tissue engineering, with extrusion bioprinting in suspended hydrogels becoming the leading bioprinting technique in recent years. In this method, living cells are incorporated within bioinks, extruded layer by layer into a granular support material followed by gelation of the bioink through diverse cross-linking mechanisms. This approach offers high fidelity and precise fabrication of complex structures mimicking living tissue properties. However, the transition of cell mass mixed with the bioink into functional native-like tissue requires post-printing cultivation in vitro. An often-overlooked drawback of 3D bioprinting is the nonuniform shrinkage and deformation of printed constructs during the post-printing tissue maturation period, leading to highly variable engineered constructs with unpredictable size and shape. This limitation poses a challenge for the technology to meet applicative requirements. A novel technology of ""print-and-grow,"" involving 3D bioprinting and subsequent cultivation in κ-Carrageenan-based microgels (CarGrow) for days is presented. CarGrow enhances the long-term structural stability of the printed objects by providing mechanical support. Moreover, this technology provides a possibility for live imaging to monitor tissue maturation.

36235084	"Modern biocompatible materials of both natural and synthetic origin, in combination with advanced techniques for their processing and functionalization, provide the basis for tissue engineering constructs (TECs) for the effective replacement of specific body defects and guided tissue regeneration. Here we describe TECs fabricated using electrospinning and 3D printing techniques on a base of synthetic (polylactic-co-glycolic acids, PLGA) and natural (collagen, COL, and hyaluronic acid, HA) polymers impregnated with core/shell β-NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+/NaYF4 upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) for in vitro control of the tissue/scaffold interaction. Polymeric structures impregnated with core/shell β-NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+/NaYF4 nanoparticles were visualized with high optical contrast using laser irradiation at 976 nm. We found that the photoluminescence spectra of impregnated scaffolds differ from the spectrum of free UCNPs that could be used to control the scaffold microenvironment, polymer biodegradation, and cargo release. We proved the absence of UCNP-impregnated scaffold cytotoxicity and demonstrated their high efficiency for cell attachment, proliferation, and colonization. We also modified the COL-based scaffold fabrication technology to increase their tensile strength and structural stability within the living body. The proposed approach is a technological platform for ""smart scaffold"" development and fabrication based on bioresorbable polymer structures impregnated with UCNPs, providing the desired photoluminescent, biochemical, and mechanical properties for intravital visualization and monitoring of their behavior and tissue/scaffold interaction in real time."

36202074	Harnessing three-dimensional (3D) bioprinted extracellular vesicles (EVs) holds great promise for advancing the fields of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. EVs are naturally occurring biological nanoparticles that are emerging as powerful 'cell-free' nanotherapeutics characterized by a cargo of protein, lipids, or genetic material that can be delivered to recipient cells. Conventional 3D bioprinting utilizes bioinks, a mixture of biomaterial and live cells, to fabricate 3D constructs for tissue regeneration purposes. The utilization of EVs instead of living cells for bioprinting may achieve targeted EV delivery, thus addressing a key challenge of EVs application in tissue engineering, as well as overcoming the regulatory and cost-effectiveness issues of using live cells. Given that 3D bioprinted EVs combine the regenerative capabilities of both bioprinting and EVs, this perspective explores the existing literature reporting their applications in tissue engineering, which target angiogenesis, osteogenesis, chondrogenesis, myogenesis, and carcinoprevention. Technical challenges and future trends for 3D bioprinted EVs in biofabrication and tissue engineering are examined. Ultimately, a personalized bioprinted EVs concept and a workflow for future bioprinted EVs studies focussed on clinical translation are proposed.	3D bioprinted extracellular vesicles for tissue engineering-a perspective.	2022	Oct	Han Pingping;Ivanovski Sašo	3D bioprinted extracellular vesicles;personalized medicine;tissue engineering	Tissue Engineering;Printing, Three-Dimensional;Bioprinting;Regenerative Medicine;Extracellular Vesicles;Tissue Scaffolds	Biofabrication	The University of Queensland, Faculty of Health and Behavioural Sciences, School of Dentistry, Center for Oral-facial Regeneration, Rehabilitation and Reconstruction (COR3), School of Dentistry, Brisbane, QLD 4006, Australia.;The University of Queensland, Faculty of Health and Behavioural Sciences, School of Dentistry, Brisbane, QLD 4006, Australia.;The University of Queensland, Faculty of Health and Behavioural Sciences, School of Dentistry, Center for Oral-facial Regeneration, Rehabilitation and Reconstruction (COR3), School of Dentistry, Brisbane, QLD 4006, Australia.;The University of Queensland, Faculty of Health and Behavioural Sciences, School of Dentistry, Brisbane, QLD 4006, Australia.

36192168	The interest in cultured meat is increasing because of the problems with conventional livestock industry. Recently, many studies related to cultured meat have been conducted, but producing large-sized cultured meat remains a challenge. It is aimed to introduce 3D bioprinting for producing large cell aggregates for cultured meat production. A hydrogel scaffold is produced at the centimeter scale using a bioink consisting of photocrosslinkable materials for digital light processing-based (DLP) printing, which has high printing accuracy and can produce geometrically complex structures. The light exposure time for hydrogel photopolymerization by DLP bioprinting is optimized based on photorheometry and cell viability assays. Naturally immortalized bovine embryonic fibroblast cells transformed with MyoD and PPARγ2 instead of primary cells are used as the latter have difficulties in maintaining stemness and are associated with animal ethics issues. The cells are mixed into the hydrogel for printing. Myogenesis and adipogenesis are induced simply by changing the medium after printing. Scaffolds are obtained successfully with living cells and large microchannels. The cooked cultured meat maintains its size and shape upon cutting. The overall dimensions are 3.43 cm × 5.53 cm × 0.96 cm. This study provides proof-of-concept for producing 3D cultured meat using bioinks.

38505275	Many recently developed 3D bioprinting strategies operate by extruding aqueous biopolymer solutions directly into a variety of different support materials constituted from swollen, solvated, aqueous, polymer assemblies. In developing these 3D printing methods and materials, great care is often taken to tune the rheological behaviors of both inks and 3D support media. By contrast, much less attention has been given to the physics of the interfaces created when structuring one polymer phase into another in embedded 3D printing applications. For example, it is currently unclear whether a dynamic interfacial tension between miscible phases stabilizes embedded 3D bioprinted structures as they are shaped while in a liquid state. Interest in the physics of interfaces between complex fluids has grown dramatically since the discovery of liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) in living cells. We believe that many new insights coming from this burst of investigation into LLPS within biological contexts can be leveraged to develop new materials and methods for improved 3D bioprinting that leverage LLPS in mixtures of biopolymers, biocompatible synthetic polymers, and proteins. Thus, in this review article, we highlight work at the interface between recent LLPS research and embedded 3D bioprinting methods and materials, and we introduce a 3D bioprinting method that leverages LLPS to stabilize printed biopolymer inks embedded in a bioprinting support material.

We prepared styrene-isobutylene-styrene triblock copolymers (SIBS; Mn = 10 kDa-25 kDa, PDI 1,3-1,6) as a drug carrier for triamcinolone acetonide (TA), further processed by fused deposition modeling to create a solid drug release system displaying improved bioavailability and applicability. Living carbocationic polymerization was used to exert control over block length and polymeric architecture. Thermorheological properties of the SIBS polymer (22.3 kDa, 38 wt % S) were adjusted to the printability of SIBS/TA mixtures (1-5% of TA), generating an effective release system effective for more than 60 days. Continuous drug release and morphological investigations were conducted to probe the influence of the 3D printing process on the drug release, enabling 3D printing as a formulation method for a slow-release system of Triamcinolone.	3D Printing of Triamcinolone Acetonide in Triblock Copolymers of Styrene-Isobutylene-Styrene as a Slow-Release System.	2022	Sep	Hilgeroth Philipp S;Thümmler Justus F;Binder Wolfgang H	3D printing;SIBS triblock copolymer;Triamcinolone acetonide;living carbocationic polymerization		Polymers	Macromolecular Chemistry, Institute of Chemistry, Martin-Luther University Halle-Wittenberg, Von-Danckelmann-Platz 4, 06120 Halle, Germany.;Macromolecular Chemistry, Institute of Chemistry, Martin-Luther University Halle-Wittenberg, Von-Danckelmann-Platz 4, 06120 Halle, Germany.;Macromolecular Chemistry, Institute of Chemistry, Martin-Luther University Halle-Wittenberg, Von-Danckelmann-Platz 4, 06120 Halle, Germany.

36134926	The lack of drinkable water is one of the most significant risks for the future of the humanity. Estimates show that in the near future, this risk will become the origin of massive migrations leading to humanitarian disaster. As consequence, the development of solutions to provide water is becoming ever more critical, and a significant effort is devoted to identifying new sources of water. Among the developed strategies, fog harvesting, which takes advantage of atmospheric water to provide potable water, is a solution of interest due to its potential in sustainable development. Unfortunately, this approach suffers from low yield. In the present work, we take inspiration from living species to design and elaborate surfaces with high potential for water harvesting applications. This work takes advantage of 3D-printing and post-printing functionalization to elaborate a strategy that allows modelling, printing, and functionalization of surfaces to yield parahydrophobic behavior. The roughness and surface morphology of the prepared surfaces were investigated. These characteristics were then related to the observed wettability and potential of the functionalized interfaces for water harvesting applications. This work highlights significant variations in surface wettability via surface modification; strong hydrophobic behavior was observed via modification with linear carboxylic acids particularly for surfaces bearing vertical blades (plate with vertical blades and grid with vertical blades).

36127859	Large-scale mammalian cell culture is essential in cell therapy, vaccine production, and the manufacturing of therapeutic protein drugs. Due to the adherent growth characteristic of most mammalian cell types, the combination of cell carrier and bioreactor is a common choice in large-scale mammalian cell culture. Current cell carriers developed by polymer crosslinking, lithography, or emulsion drops are unable to obtain a structure with uniformed porous structure and porous interior design, which results in an inhomogeneous culture condition for cells and therefore cannot ensure an optimal dynamic culture condition for cell proliferation, matrix production, and cell differentiation. In addition, the fluidic shear stress (a standard mechanical stimulation in bioreactor culture) and inner-carrier velocity (to ensure nutrient transport and waste exchange), which influence cell viability and growth, are not well-controlled/analyzed due to an irregular porous structure with these traditionally synthesized cell carriers. To solve these problems, we designed four types of hollow porous spheres (HPS, 1.0 cm diameter) with different porous structures. To investigate the impacts of porous structure on surface shear stress and inner velocity, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations were conducted to analyze the liquid flow behavior in HPSs, based on which an optimal structure with minimal surface shear stress and best inner velocity was obtained and fabricated using fused deposition modeling three-dimensional (3D) printing technology. Inspired by the industrial large-scale culture system, a novel 3D dynamic culture system was then established using HPSs to seed the cells, which were then placed in a mini bioreactor on a tube roller. CFD analysis showed that under 0.1 m/s water flow, the shear stress at most surface areas from four HPSs was lower than 20 dynes/cm2, which suggests that the HPSs should provide protection against physical stress to the cells living on the scaffold surface. A dynamic cell seeding was developed and refined using the 3D culture system, which increased the 32% seeding efficiency of MC3T3 cells compared to the traditional static cell seeding method. The cell proliferation analysis demonstrated that HPSs could speed up cell growth in dynamic cell culture. The HPS with a honeycomb-like structure showed the highest inner pore velocity (CFD analysis) and achieved the fastest cell proliferation and the highest cell viability. Overall, our study, for the first time, developed a 3D printed HPS cell culture device with a uniformed porous structure, which can effectively facilitate cell adhesion and proliferation in the dynamic cultural environment, thereby could be considered an ideal carrier candidate.

36067747	Three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting precisely deposits picolitre bioink to fabricate functional tissues and organs in a layer-by-layer manner. The bioink used for 3D bioprinting incorporates living cells. During printing, cells suspended in the bioink sediment to form cell aggregates through cell-cell interaction. The formation of cell aggregates due to cell sedimentation have been widely recognized as a significant challenge to affect the printing reliability and quality. This study has incorporated the active circulation into the bioink reservoir to mitigate cell sedimentation and aggregation. Force and velocity analysis were performed, and a circulation model has been proposed based on iteration algorithm with the time step for each divided region. It has been found that (a) the comparison of the cell sedimentation and aggregation with and without the active bioink circulation has demonstrated high effectiveness of active circulation to mitigate cell sedimentation and aggregation for the bioink with both a low cell concentration of 1 × 106cells ml-1and a high cell concentration of 5 × 106cells ml-1; and (b) the effect of circulation flow rate on cell sedimentation and aggregation has been investigated, showing that large flow rate results in slow increments in effectiveness. Besides, the predicted mitigation effectiveness percentages on cell sedimentation by the circulation model generally agrees well with the experimental results. In addition, the cell viability assessment at the recommended maximum flow rate of 0.5 ml min-1has demonstrated negligible cell damage due to the circulation. The proposed active circulation approach is an effective and efficient approach with superior performance in mitigating cell sedimentation and aggregation, and the resulting knowledge is easily applicable to other 3D bioprinting techniques significantly improving printing reliability and quality in 3D bioprinting.

36063577	Bacterial cellulose is an attractive resource for the manufacturing of sustainable materials, but it is usually challenging to shape it into elaborate three-dimensional structures. Here, we report a manufacturing platform for the creation of complex-shaped cellulose objects by printing inks loaded with bacteria into a silicone-based granular gel. The gel provides the viscoelastic behavior necessary to shape the bacteria-laden ink in three dimensions and the gas permeability required to sustain cellular growth and cellulose formation after the printing process. Using Gluconacetobacter xylinus as model cellulose-producing bacteria, we study the growth and the mechanical properties of cellulose fiber networks obtained upon incubation of the printed inks. Diffusion processes within the ink were found to control the growth of the cellulose structures, which display mechanical properties within the range expected for conventional hydrogels. By keeping the bacteria alive in the printed object, we produce living materials in complex geometries that are able to self-regenerate their cellulose fiber network after damage. Such living hydrogels represent an enticing development towards functional materials with autonomous self-healing and self-regenerating capabilities.

36055612	"Osteochondral tissue has a complex hierarchical structure spanning subchondral bone to articular cartilage. Biomaterials approaches to mimic and repair these interfaces have had limited success, largely due to challenges in fabricating composite hard-soft interfaces with living cells. Biofabrication approaches have emerged as attractive methods to form osteochondral analogues through additive assembly of hard and soft components. We have developed a unique printing platform that is able to integrate soft and hard materials concurrently through freeform printing of mineralized constructs within tunable microgel suspensions containing living cells. A library of microgels based on gelatin were prepared, where the stiffness of the microgels and a liquid ""filler"" phase can be tuned for bioprinting while simultaneously directing differentiation. Tuning microgel stiffness and filler content differentially directs chondrogenesis and osteogenesis within the same construct, demonstrating how this technique can be used to fabricate osteochondral interfaces in a single step. Printing of a rapidly setting calcium phosphate cement, so called ""bone-ink"" within a cell laden suspension bath further guides differentiation, where the cells adjacent to the nucleated hydroxyapatite phase undergo osteogenesis with cells in the surrounding medium undergoing chondrogenesis. In this way, bone analogues with hierarchical structure can be formed within cell-laden gradient soft matrices to yield multiphasic osteochondral constructs. This technique provides a versatile one-pot biofabrication approach without harsh post-processing which will aid efforts in bone disease modelling and tissue engineering. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: This paper demonstrates the first example of a biofabrication approach to rapidly form osteochondral constructs in a single step under physiological conditions. Key to this advance is a tunable suspension of extracellular matrix microgels that are packed together with stem cells, providing a unique and modular scaffolding for guiding the simultaneous formation of bone and cartilage tissue. The physical properties of the suspension allow direct writing of a ceramic ""bone-ink"", resulting in an ordered structure of microscale hydrogels, living cells, and bone mimics in a single step. This platform reveals a simple approach to making complex skeletal tissue for disease modelling, with the possibility of repairing and replacing bone-cartilage interfaces in the clinic using a patient's own cells."

36041651	The development of tissue engineering strategies for treatment of large bone defects has become increasingly relevant, given the growing demand for bone substitutes. Native bone is composed of a dense vascular network necessary for the regulation of bone development, regeneration and homeostasis. A major obstacle in fabricating living, clinically relevant-sized bone mimics (1-10 cm3) is the limited supply of nutrients, including oxygen to the core of the construct. Therefore, strategies to support vascularization are pivotal for the development of tissue engineered bone constructs. Creating a functional bone construct integrated with a vascular network, capable of delivering the necessary nutrients for optimal tissue development is imperative for translation into the clinics. The vascular system is composed of a complex network that runs throughout the body in a tree-like hierarchical branching fashion. A significant challenge for tissue engineering approaches lies in mimicking the intricate, multi-scale structures consisting of larger vessels (macro-vessels) which interconnect with multiple sprouting vessels (microvessels) in a closed network. The advent of biofabrication has enabled complex, out of plane channels to be generated and has laid the groundwork for the creation of multi-scale vasculature in recent years. This review highlights the key state-of-the-art achievements for the development of vascular networks of varying scales in the field of biofabrication with a particular focus for its application in developing a functional tissue engineered bone construct. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: There is a growing need for bone substitutes to overcome the limited supply of patient-derived bone. Bone tissue engineering aims to overcome this by combining stem cells with scaffolds to restore missing bone. The current bottleneck in upscaling is the lack of an integrated vascular network, required for the delivery of nutrients to cells. 3D bioprinting techniques has enabled the creation of complex hollow structures of varying dimensions that resemble native blood vessels. The convergence of multiple materials, cell types and fabrication approaches, opens the possibility of developing clinically-relevant sized vascularized bone constructs. This review provides an up-to-date insight of the technologies currently available for the generation of complex vascular networks, with a focus on their application in bone tissue engineering.

36027838	3D bioprinting has become a popular medical technique in recent years. The most compelling rationale for the development of 3D bioprinting is the paucity of biological structures required for the rehabilitation of missing organs and tissues. They're useful in a multitude of domains, including disease modelling, regenerative medicine, tissue engineering, drug discovery with testing, personalised medicine, organ development, toxicity studies, and implants. Bioprinting requires a range of bioprinting technologies and bioinks to finish their procedure, that Inkjet-based bioprinting, extrusion-based bioprinting, laser-assisted bioprinting, stereolithography-based bioprinting, and in situ bioprinting are some of the technologies listed here. Bioink is a 3D printing material that is used to construct engineered artificial living tissue. It can be constructed solely for cells, but it usually includes a carrier substance that envelops the cells, then there's Agarose-based bioinks, alginate-based bioinks, collagen-based bioinks, and hyaluronic acid-based bioinks, to name a few.

36004925	3D-printed hemipelvic endoprosthesis is an emerging solution for personalized limb-salvage reconstruction after periacetabular tumor resection. Further clinical studies are still required to report its surgical characteristics, outcomes, benefits and drawbacks. Sixteen consecutive patients underwent periacetabular tumor wide resection and pelvic reconstruction with a 3D-printed hemipelvic endoprosthesis from 2018 to 2021. The surgical characteristics and outcomes are described. The mean follow-up duration was 17.75 months (range, 6 to 46 months). Five patients underwent surgery for type I + II resection and reconstruction, seven for type II + III resection and reconstruction, three for type II resection and reconstruction, and one for type I + II + IV resection and reconstruction. The incidence of postoperative complication was 12.5% (2/16) for deep venous thrombosis (DVT), 12.5% (2/16) for pneumonia, and 12.5% (2/16) for would deep or superficial infection. During follow-up, two patients (12.5%) suffered hip dislocation and underwent revision surgery. CT demonstrated an obvious prosthetic porous structure-bone fusion after follow-up of at least 6 months. At the final follow-up, 12 lived with no evidence of disease while four lived with disease; no patients experienced pain; and 15 had independent ambulation, with a mean Musculoskeletal Tumor Society (MSTS) score of 85.8% (range, 26.7% to 100%). 3D-printed hemipelvic endoprosthesis facilitates wide resection of periacetabular tumor and limb-salvage reconstruction, thus resulting in good oncological and functional outcomes. The custom-made nature is able to well mimic the skeletal anatomy and microstructure and promote osseointegration. Perioperative complications and rehabilitation exercise still need to be stressed for this engineering technology-assisted major orthopedic surgery.

35988998	Hydrogels have been widely exploited as inks for three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting, a useful technique for building complex biological structures with living cells. However, hydrogels have inherently limited mechanical properties (e.g., brittleness) and printability. Thus, we hypothesized that hyaluronate-based hydrogels with stretchable and self-healing properties would be useful for 3D bioprinting. Oxidized hyaluronate (oHA) and hydrazide-modified hyaluronate (hHA) formed stretchable and flexible hydrogels because of double network formation via chemical cross-linking (i.e., acylhydrazone bond formation) and physical cross-linking (i.e., charge interaction). The addition of adipic acid dihydrazide (ADH) to oHA/hHA hydrogels enhanced the self-healing capability of the gels, which were useful for fabricating 3D constructs with various shapes maintaining their stretchability even after 3D printing (about two times its original length). ATDC5 cells were viable within the 3D-printed constructs in vitro. This hydrogel system, consisting of hyaluronic acid (HA)-based polymers, may have potential for many tissue engineering applications via 3D bioprinting.

35965664	With technological advance has come the possibility of a new era of abundance. Technologies like 3D printing and robotics promise to lower the costs of production and distribution of goods and services, presumably making these goods and services readily available to those across income and wealth spectrums. This undoubtedly is a good thing. But what will be the effect of these technologies on existing wealth inequalities and the psychological and societal burdens they impose? Can we expect that this newfound abundance will help remedy the current historic levels of inequality in the U.S. and other western countries? Unfortunately, the answer is likely no, for two reasons. First, history suggests that inequality often persists even under conditions of abundance due to dynamics of power and politics and ongoing impacts of structural inequalities. Having more than enough of a particular good or service to go around does not guarantee that all will have access to this good or service. Second, even if the new abundance enabled by technology extends into all levels of the socioeconomic spectrum, enabling individuals to access goods and services (and their attendant benefits) previously beyond their reach, the harms that attend unequal societies will persist. Increasing evidence suggests that these harms, including increased violence and decreased health, arise not from access (or a lack thereof) to particular goods and services, but from the adverse psychological consequences of living in an unequal society. This is a psychological burden shared not just by those at the losing end of the inequality equation, but also those who enjoy a relative advantage in society. Unequal societies are psychologically harmful to all who live in them, regardless of where these individuals fall on the socioeconomic spectrum, and largely independent of the particular goods and services they enjoy. The upshot is that society cannot rely on new abundance technologies to automatically solve problems of inequality and the social and psychological burdens that plague those who live in unequal societies. Indeed, depending on how society responds to questions of access to these technologies, their introduction might exacerbate various forms of inequality. In light of this, it is crucial to address conditions of inequality head-on, so that the new era of abundance promised by technological advance can lead to real gains in individual and societal wellbeing.

35964390	The design of engineered living materials (ELMs) is an emerging field developed from synthetic biology and materials science principles. ELMs are multi-scale bulk materials that combine the properties of self-healing and organism adaptability with the designed physicochemical or mechanical properties for functional applications in various fields, including therapy, electronics, and architecture. Among the many ELM design and manufacturing methods, three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting stands out for its precise control over the structure of the fabricated constructs and the spatial distribution of cells. In this review, we summarize the progress in the field, cell type and material selection, and the latest applications of 3D bioprinting to manufacture ELMs, as well as their advantages and limitations, hoping to deepen our understanding and provide new insights into ELM design. We believe that 3D bioprinting will become an important development direction and provide more contributions to this field.

35957122	Mechanotransduction refers to the cellular ability to sense mechanical stimuli from the surrounding environment and convert them into biochemical signals that regulate cellular physiology and homeostasis. Mechanosensitive ion channels (MSCs), especially ones of Piezo family (Piezo1 and Piezo2), play a crucial role in mechanotransduction. These transmembrane proteins directly react to mechanical cues by triggering the onset of an ionic current. The relevance of this mechanism in driving physiology and pathology is emerging, and there is a growing need for the identification of an affordable and reliable assay to measure it. Setting up a mechanosensitivity assay requires exerting a mechanical stimulus on single cells while observing the downstream effects of channels opening. We propose an open-hardware approach to stimulate single adherent cells through controlled microindentation, using a 3D-printed actuation platform. We validated the device by measuring the mechanosensitivity of a neural mice cell line where the expression level and activity of Piezo1 were genetically and pharmacologically manipulated. Moreover, this extremely versatile device could be integrated with different read-out technologies, offering a new tool to improve the understanding of mechanotransduction in living cells.

35956602	Arterial stenosis or blockage is the leading cause of cardiovascular disease, and the common solution is to substitute the arteries by autologous veins or bypass the blood vessels physically. With the development of science and technology, arteries with diameter larger than 6 mm can be substituted by unbiodegradable polymers, such as polytetrafluoroethylene, clinically. Nevertheless, the construction of a small-diameter (less than 6 mm) artery with living cells has always been a thorny problem. In this study, a suit of combined mold was designed and forged for constructing small-diameter arterial vessels. Based on this combined mold, bioactive arterial vessels containing adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) and different growth factors (GFs) were assembled together to mimic the inner and middle layers of the natural arteries. Before assembling, ASCs and GFs were loaded into a gelatin/alginate hydrogel. To enhance the mechanical property of the bilayer arterial vessels, polylactic-glycolic acid (PLGA) was applied on the surface of the bilayer vessels to form the outer third layer. The biocompatibility, morphology and mechanical property of the constructed triple-layer arterial vessels were characterized. The morphological results manifested that cells grow well in the gelatin/alginate hydrogels, and ASCs were differentiated into endothelial cells (ECs) and smooth muscle cells (SMCs), respectively. In addition, under the action of shear stress produced by the flow of the culture medium, cells in the hydrogels with high density were connected to each other, similar to the natural vascular endothelial tissues (i.e., endothelia). Especially, the mechanical property of the triple-layer arterial vessels can well meet the anti-stress requirements as human blood vessels. In a word, a small-diameter arterial vessel was successfully constructed through the combined mold and has a promising application prospect as a clinical small-diameter vessel graft.

35930168	The biofabrication of living constructs containing hollow channels is critical for manufacturing thick tissues. However, current technologies are limited in their effectiveness in the fabrication of channels with diameters smaller than hundreds of micrometers. It is demonstrated that the co-extrusion of cell-laden hydrogels and sacrificial materials through printheads containing Kenics static mixing elements enables the continuous and one-step fabrication of thin hydrogel filaments (1 mm in diameter) containing dozens of hollow microchannels with widths as small as a single cell. Pre-vascularized skeletal muscle-like filaments are bioprinted by loading murine myoblasts (C2C12 cells) in gelatin methacryloyl - alginate hydrogels and using hydroxyethyl cellulose as a sacrificial material. Higher viability and metabolic activity are observed in filaments with hollow multi-channels than in solid constructs. The presence of hollow channels promotes the expression of Ki67 (a proliferation biomarker), mitigates the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha , and markedly enhances cell alignment (i.e., 82% of muscle myofibrils aligned (in ±10°) to the main direction of the microchannels after seven days of culture). The emergence of sarcomeric α-actin is verified through immunofluorescence and gene expression. Overall, this work presents an effective and practical tool for the fabrication of pre-vascularized engineered tissues.

35920614	Structured microparticles, with unique shapes, customizable sizes, multiple materials, and spatially-defined chemistries, are leading the way for emerging 'lab on a particle' technologies. These microparticles with engineered designs find applications in multiplexed diagnostics, drug delivery, single-cell secretion assays, single-molecule detection assays, high throughput cytometry, micro-robotics, self-assembly, and tissue engineering. In this article we review state-of-the-art particle manufacturing technologies based on flow-assisted photolithography performed inside microfluidic channels. Important physicochemical concepts are discussed to provide a basis for understanding the fabrication technologies. These photolithography technologies are compared based on the structural as well as compositional complexity of the fabricated particles. Particles are categorized, from 1D to 3D particles, based on the number of dimensions that can be independently controlled during the fabrication process. After discussing the advantages of the individual techniques, important applications of the fabricated particles are reviewed. Lastly, a future perspective is provided with potential directions to improve the throughput of particle fabrication, realize new particle shapes, measure particles in an automated manner, and adopt the 'lab on a particle' technologies to other areas of research.

35917808	In additive manufacturing, bioink formulations govern strategies to engineer 3D living tissues that mimic the complex architectures and functions of native tissues for successful tissue regeneration. Conventional 3D-printed tissues are limited in their ability to alter the fate of laden cells. Specifically, the efficient delivery of gene expression regulators (i.e. microRNAs (miRNAs)) to cells in bioprinted tissues has remained largely elusive. In this study, we explored the inclusion of extracellular vesicles (EVs), naturally occurring nanovesicles (NVs), into bioinks to resolve this challenge. EVs show excellent biocompatibility, rapid endocytosis, and low immunogenicity, which lead to the efficient delivery of miRNAs without measurable cytotoxicity. EVs were fused with liposomes to prolong and control their release by altering their physical interaction with the bioink. Hybrid EVs-liposome (hEL) NVs were embedded in gelatin-based hydrogels to create bioinks that could efficiently encapsulate and deliver miRNAs at the target site in a controlled and sustained manner. The regulation of cells' gene expression in a 3D bioprinted matrix was achieved using the hELs-laden bioink as a precursor for excellent shape fidelity and high cell viability constructs. Novel regulatory factors-loaded bioinks will expedite the translation of new bioprinting applications in the tissue engineering field.

35913255	Current drug screening approaches are incapable of fully detecting and characterizing drug effectiveness and toxicity of human cardiomyocytes. The pharmaceutical industry uses mathematical models, cell lines, and in vivo models. Many promising drugs are abandoned early in development, and some cardiotoxic drugs reach humans leading to drug recalls. Therefore, there is an unmet need to have more reliable and predictive tools for drug discovery and screening applications. Biofabrication of functional cardiac tissues holds great promise for developing a faithful 3D in vitro disease model, optimizing drug screening efficiencies enabling precision medicine. Different fabrication techniques including molding, pull spinning and 3D bioprinting were used to develop tissue-engineered heart chambers. The big challenge is to effectively organize cells into tissue with structural and physiological features resembling native tissues. Some advancements have been made in engineering miniaturized heart chambers that resemble a living pump for drug screening and disease modeling applications.

35906208	Structural color is frequently exploited by living organisms for biological functions and has also been translated into synthetic materials as a more durable and less hazardous alternative to conventional pigments. Additive manufacturing approaches were recently exploited for the fabrication of exquisite photonic objects, but the angle-dependence observed limits a broader application of structural color in synthetic systems. Here, we propose a manufacturing platform for the 3D printing of complex-shaped objects that display isotropic structural color generated from photonic colloidal glasses. Structurally colored objects are printed from aqueous colloidal inks containing monodisperse silica particles, carbon black, and a gel-forming copolymer. Rheology and Small-Angle-X-Ray-Scattering measurements are performed to identify the processing conditions leading to printed objects with tunable structural colors. Multimaterial printing is eventually used to create complex-shaped objects with multiple structural colors using silica and carbon as abundant and sustainable building blocks.

35888198	The high cost of biofabricated titanium mesh plates can make them out of reach for hospitals in low-income countries. To increase the availability of cranioplasty, the authors of this work investigated the production of polymer-based endoprostheses. Recently, cheap, popular desktop 3D printers have generated sufficient opportunities to provide patients with on-demand and on-site help. This study also examines the technologies of 3D printing, including SLM, SLS, FFF, DLP, and SLA. The authors focused their interest on the materials in fabrication, which include PLA, ABS, PET-G, PEEK, and PMMA. Three-dimensional printed prostheses are modeled using widely available CAD software with the help of patient-specific DICOM files. Even though the topic is insufficiently researched, it can be perceived as a relatively safe procedure with a minimal complication rate. There have also been some initial studies on the costs and legal regulations. Early case studies provide information on dozens of patients living with self-made prostheses and who are experiencing significant improvements in their quality of life. Budget 3D-printed endoprostheses are reliable and are reported to be significantly cheaper than the popular counterparts manufactured from polypropylene polyester.

35853599	Ubiquitous in embryonic development, tissue fusion is of interest to tissue engineers who use tissue spheroids or organoids as building blocks of three-dimensional (3D) multicellular constructs. This review presents mathematical models and computer simulations of the fusion of tissue spheroids. The motivation of this study stems from the need to predict the post-printing evolution of 3D bioprinted constructs. First, we provide a brief overview of differential adhesion, the main morphogenetic mechanism involved in post-printing structure formation. It will be shown that clusters of cohesive cells behave as an incompressible viscous fluid on the time scale of hours. The discussion turns then to mathematical models based on the continuum hydrodynamics of highly viscous liquids and on statistical mechanics. Next, we analyze the validity and practical use of computational models of multicellular self-assembly in live constructs created by tissue spheroid bioprinting. Finally, we discuss the perspectives of the field as machine learning starts to reshape experimental design, and modular robotic workstations tend to alleviate the burden of repetitive tasks in biofabrication. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Bioprinted constructs are living systems, which evolve via morphogenetic mechanisms known from developmental biology. This review presents mathematical and computational tools devised for modeling post-printing structure formation. They help achieving a desirable outcome without expensive optimization experiments. While previous reviews mainly focused on assumptions, technical details, strengths, and limitations of computational models of multicellular self-assembly, this article discusses their validity and practical use in biofabrication. It also presents an overview of mathematical models that proved to be useful in the evaluation of experimental data on tissue spheroid fusion, and in the calibration of computational models. Finally, the perspectives of the field are discussed in the advent of robotic biofabrication platforms and bioprinting process optimization by machine learning.

35851272	"Printing a structured network of functionalized droplets in a liquid medium enables engineering collectives of living cells for functional purposes and promises enormous applications in processes ranging from energy storage to tissue engineering. Current approaches are limited to drop-by-drop printing or face limitations in reproducing the sophisticated internal features of a structured material and its interactions with the surrounding media. Here, we report a simple approach for creating stable liquid filaments of silica nanoparticle dispersions and use them as inks to print all-in-liquid materials that consist of a network of droplets. Silica nanoparticles stabilize liquid filaments at Weber numbers two orders of magnitude smaller than previously reported in liquid-liquid systems by rapidly producing a concentrated emulsion zone at the oil-water interface. We experimentally demonstrate the printed aqueous phase is emulsified in-situ; consequently, a 3D structure is achieved with flexible walls consisting of layered emulsions. The tube-like printed features have a spongy texture resembling miniaturized versions of ""tube sponges"" found in the oceans. A scaling analysis based on the interplay between hydrodynamics and emulsification kinetics reveals that filaments are formed when emulsions are generated and remain at the interface during the printing period. Stabilized filaments are utilized for printing liquid-based fluidic channels."

35819363	Engineered living materials (ELMs) that incorporate living organisms and synthetic materials enable advanced functional properties. Here, we seek to create plant cyborgs by combining plants or plant tissues with stimuli-responsive polymeric materials. Plant tissues with integrated shape control may find applications in regenerative medicine, and the shape control of living plants enables another dimension of adaptability and response to environmental threats, which can be applied to next-generation precision farming. In this work, we develop chemistry to integrate stimuli-responsive poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) hydrogels with decellularized plant tissues assisted by 3D printing. We demonstrate programmable shape morphing in response to thermal cues and ultraviolet (UV) light. Specifically, by taking advantage of the extrusion-based 3D printing method, we deposit nanocomposite PNIPAM precursors onto silane-treated decellularized leaf surface with prescribed shapes and spatial control. When subjected to external stimuli, the strain mismatch generated between the swellable nanocomposite PNIPAM and nonswellable decellularized leaf enables folding and bending to occur. This strategy to integrate the plant tissues with stimuli-responsive hydrogels allows the control of leaf morphology, opening avenues for plant-based biosensors and soft actuators to enhance food security; such materials also may find applications in biomedicine as tissue-engineering scaffolds.

35787568	3D printing changes the scope of how samples can be mounted for small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). In this paper a 3D-printed X-ray chamber, which allows for in situ exchange of buffer and in situ optical transmission spectroscopy, is presented. The chamber is made of cyclic olefin copolymers (COC), including COC X-ray windows providing ultra-low SAXS background. The design integrates a membrane insert for in situ dialysis of the 100 µl sample volume against a reservoir, which enables measurements of the same sample under multiple conditions using an in-house X-ray setup equipped with a 17.4 keV molybdenum source. The design's capabilities are demonstrated by measuring reversible structural changes in lipid and polymer systems as a function of salt concentration and pH. In the same chambers optical light transmission spectroscopy was carried out measuring the optical turbidity of the mesophases and local pH values using pH-responsive dyes. Microfluidic exchange and optical spectroscopy combined with in situ X-ray scattering enables vast applications for the study of responsive materials.	3D-printed SAXS chamber for controlled in situ dialysis and optical characterization.	2022	Jul	Ehm Tamara;Philipp Julian;Barkey Martin;Ober Martina;Brinkop Achim Theo;Simml David;Von Westphalen Miriam;Nickel Bert;Beck Roy;Rädler Joachim O	3D printing;cyclic olefin copolymer;in situ dialysis;in-house measurements;small-angle X-ray scattering	Printing, Three-Dimensional;Renal Dialysis;Scattering, Small Angle;X-Ray Diffraction;X-Rays	Journal of synchrotron radiation	School of Physics and Astronomy, Center for Physics and Chemistry of Living Systems, and Center for Nanoscience and Nanotechnology, Tel Aviv University, Ramat Aviv, Israel.;Faculty of Physics, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität, Geschwister-Scholl-Platz 1, Munich, Germany.;Faculty of Physics, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität, Geschwister-Scholl-Platz 1, Munich, Germany.;Faculty of Physics, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität, Geschwister-Scholl-Platz 1, Munich, Germany.;Faculty of Physics, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität, Geschwister-Scholl-Platz 1, Munich, Germany.;Faculty of Physics, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität, Geschwister-Scholl-Platz 1, Munich, Germany.;Faculty of Physics, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität, Geschwister-Scholl-Platz 1, Munich, Germany.;Faculty of Physics, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität, Geschwister-Scholl-Platz 1, Munich, Germany.;School of Physics and Astronomy, Center for Physics and Chemistry of Living Systems, and Center for Nanoscience and Nanotechnology, Tel Aviv University, Ramat Aviv, Israel.;Faculty of Physics, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität, Geschwister-Scholl-Platz 1, Munich, Germany.

35767151	Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a disabling and destructive central nervous system injury that has not yet been successfully treated at this stage. Three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting has become a promising method to produce more biologically complex microstructures, which fabricate living neural constructs with anatomically accurate complex geometries and spatial distributions of neural stem cells, and this is critical in the treatment of SCI. With the development of 3D printing technology and the deepening of research, neural tissue engineering research using different printing methods, bio-inks, and cells to repair SCI has achieved certain results. Although satisfactory results have not yet been achieved, they have provided novel ideas for the clinical treatment of SCI. Considering the potential impact of 3D bioprinting technology on neural studies, this review focuses on 3D bioprinting methods widely used in SCI neural tissue engineering, and the latest technological applications of bioprinting of nerve tissues for the repair of SCI are discussed.

35765706	In the current pandemic, scenario the world is facing a huge shortage of effective drugs and other prophylactic medicine to treat patients which created havoc in several countries with poor resources. With limited demand and supply of effective drugs, researchers rushed to repurpose the existing approved drugs for the treatment of COVID-19. The process of drug screening and testing is very costly and requires several steps for validation and treatment efficacy evaluation ranging from in-vitro to in-vivo setups. After these steps, a clinical trial is mandatory for the evaluation of treatment efficacy and side effects in humans. These processes enhance the overall cost and sometimes the lead molecule show adverse effects in humans and the trial ends up in the final stages. Recently with the advent of three-dimensional (3D) organoid culture which mimics the human tissue exactly the process of drug screening and testing can be done in a faster and cost-effective manner. Further 3D organoids prepared from stems cells taken from individuals can be beneficial for personalized drug therapy which could save millions of lives. This review discussed approaches and techniques for the synthesis of 3D-printed human organoids for drug screening. The key findings of the usage of organoids for personalized medicine for the treatment of COVID-19 have been discussed. In the end, the key challenges for the wide applicability of human organoids for drug screening with prospects of future orientation have been included.	3D printed human organoids: High throughput system for drug screening and testing in current COVID-19 pandemic.	2022	Oct	Parihar Arpana;Pandita Vasundhara;Khan Raju	3D printing;COVID-19;drug repurposing;human organoids;personalized medicine	Drug Evaluation, Preclinical;Humans;Organoids;Pandemics;Printing, Three-Dimensional;COVID-19 Drug Treatment	Biotechnology and bioengineering	Industrial Waste Utilization, Nano and Biomaterials, CSIR-Advanced Materials and Processes Research Institute (AMPRI), Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh, India.;Department of Biosciences, Barkatullah University, Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh, India.;Industrial Waste Utilization, Nano and Biomaterials, CSIR-Advanced Materials and Processes Research Institute (AMPRI), Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh, India.;Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research (AcSIR), Ghaziabad, India.

35760993	Despite considerable advances in cancer research and oncological treatments, the burden of the disease is still extremely high. While past research has been cancer cell centered, it is now clear that to understand tumors, the models that serve as a framework for research and therapeutic testing need to improve and integrate cancer microenvironment characteristics such as mechanics, architecture, and cell heterogeneity. Microfluidics is a powerful tool for biofabrication of cancer-relevant architectures given its capacity to manipulate cells and materials at very small dimensions and integrate varied living tissue characteristics. This chapter outlines the current microfluidic toolbox for fabricating living constructs, starting by explaining the varied configurations of 3D soft constructs microfluidics enables when used to process hydrogels. Then, we analyze the possibilities to control material flows and create space varying characteristics such as gradients or advanced 3D micro-architectures. Envisioning the trend to approach the complexity of tumor microenvironments also at higher dimensions, we discuss microfluidic-enabled 3D bioprinting and recent advances in that arena. Finally, we summarize the future possibilities for microfluidic biofabrication to tackle important challenges in cancer 3D modelling, including tools for the fast quantification of biological events toward data-driven and precision medicine approaches.

35756965	Bacterial communities form biofilms on various surfaces by synthesizing a cohesive and protective extracellular matrix, and these biofilms protect microorganisms against harsh environmental conditions. Bacillus subtilis is a widely used experimental species, and its biofilms are used as representative models of beneficial biofilms. Specifically, B. subtilis biofilms are known to be rich in extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) and other biopolymers such as DNA and proteins like the amyloid protein TasA and the hydrophobic protein BslA. These materials, which form an interconnected, cohesive, three-dimensional polymer network, provide the mechanical stability of biofilms and mediate their adherence to surfaces among other functional contributions. Here, we explored how genetically-encoded components specifically contribute to regulate the growth status, mechanical properties, and antibiotic resistance of B. subtilis biofilms, thereby establishing a solid empirical basis for understanding how various genetic engineering efforts are likely to affect the structure and function of biofilms. We noted discrete contributions to biofilm morphology, mechanical properties, and survival from major biofilm components such as EPS, TasA and BslA. For example, EPS plays an important role in maintaining the stability of the mechanical properties and the antibiotic resistance of biofilms, whereas BslA has a significant impact on the resolution that can be obtained for printing applications. This work provides a deeper understanding of the internal interactions of biofilm components through systematic genetic manipulations. It thus not only broadens the application prospects of beneficial biofilms, but also serves as the basis of future strategies for targeting and effectively removing harmful biofilms.

35745597	Three-dimensional (3D) printing is a technique where the products are printed layer-by-layer via a series of cross-sectional slices with the exact deposition of different cell types and biomaterials based on computer-aided design software. Three-dimensional printing can be divided into several approaches, such as extrusion-based printing, laser-induced forward transfer-based printing systems, and so on. Bio-ink is a crucial tool necessary for the fabrication of the 3D construct of living tissue in order to mimic the native tissue/cells using 3D printing technology. The formation of 3D software helps in the development of novel drug delivery systems with drug screening potential, as well as 3D constructs of tumor models. Additionally, several complex structures of inner tissues like stroma and channels of different sizes are printed through 3D printing techniques. Three-dimensional printing technology could also be used to develop therapy training simulators for educational purposes so that learners can practice complex surgical procedures. The fabrication of implantable medical devices using 3D printing technology with less risk of infections is receiving increased attention recently. A Cancer-on-a-chip is a microfluidic device that recreates tumor physiology and allows for a continuous supply of nutrients or therapeutic compounds. In this review, based on the recent literature, we have discussed various printing methods for 3D printing and types of bio-inks, and provided information on how 3D printing plays a crucial role in cancer management.

35743934	Trauma and bone loss from infections, tumors, and congenital diseases make bone repair and regeneration the greatest challenges in orthopedic, craniofacial, and plastic surgeries. The shortage of donors, intrinsic limitations, and complications in transplantation have led to more focus and interest in regenerative medicine. Structures that closely mimic bone tissue can be produced by this unique technology. The steady development of three-dimensional (3D)-printed bone tissue engineering scaffold therapy has played an important role in achieving the desired goal. Bioceramic scaffolds are widely studied and appear to be the most promising solution. In addition, 3D printing technology can simulate mechanical and biological surface properties and print with high precision complex internal and external structures to match their functional properties. Inkjet, extrusion, and light-based 3D printing are among the rapidly advancing bone bioprinting technologies. Furthermore, stem cell therapy has recently shown an important role in this field, although large tissue defects are difficult to fill by injection alone. The combination of 3D-printed bone tissue engineering scaffolds with stem cells has shown very promising results. Therefore, biocompatible artificial tissue engineering with living cells is the key element required for clinical applications where there is a high demand for bone defect repair.

35743006	Three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting is an innovative technology in the biomedical field, allowing the fabrication of living constructs through an approach of layer-by-layer deposition of cell-laden inks, the so-called bioinks. An ideal bioink should possess proper mechanical, rheological, chemical, and biological characteristics to ensure high cell viability and the production of tissue constructs with dimensional stability and shape fidelity. Among the several types of bioinks, hydrogels are extremely appealing as they have many similarities with the extracellular matrix, providing a highly hydrated environment for cell proliferation and tunability in terms of mechanical and rheological properties. Hydrogels derived from natural polymers, and polysaccharides, in particular, are an excellent platform to mimic the extracellular matrix, given their low cytotoxicity, high hydrophilicity, and diversity of structures. In fact, polysaccharide-based hydrogels are trendy materials for 3D bioprinting since they are abundant and combine adequate physicochemical and biomimetic features for the development of novel bioinks. Thus, this review portrays the most relevant advances in polysaccharide-based hydrogel bioinks for 3D bioprinting, focusing on the last five years, with emphasis on their properties, advantages, and limitations, considering polysaccharide families classified according to their source, namely from seaweed, higher plants, microbial, and animal (particularly crustaceans) origin.

Today, molecular biology teaches us that microbes play important roles in human health, and that isolation from them puts not only us but also other inhabitants of urban landscapes, at risk. In order to provide an environment that makes honeybees more resilient to environmental changes, we aim for combining the thermal insulation functionality of mycelium materials with bioactive therapeutic properties within beehive constructions. By identifying mycelial fungi's interactions with nest-related materials, using digital methods to design a hive structure, and engaging in additive manufacturing, we were able to develop a set of methods for designing and fabricating a fully grown hive. We propose two digital methods for modelling 3D scaffolds for micro-super organism co-occupation scenarios: ""variable-offset"" and ""iterative-subtraction"", followed by two inoculation methods for the biofabrication of scaffolded fungal composites. The HIVEOPOLIS project aims to diversify and complexify urban ecological niches to make them more resilient to future game changers such as climate change. The combined functions of mycelium materials have the potential to provide a therapeutic environment for honeybees and, potentially, humans in the future."

35724647	Cell spheroids have recently emerged as an effective tool to recapitulate native microenvironments of living organisms in anin vitroscenario, increasing the reliability of the results obtained and broadening their applications in regenerative medicine, cancer research, disease modeling and drug screening. In this study the generation of spheroids containing primary human dermal fibroblasts was approached using the two-widely employed methods: hanging-drop and U-shape low adhesion plate (LA-plate). Moreover, extrusion-based three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting was introduced to achieve a standardized and scalable production of cell spheroids, decreasing considerably the possibilities of human error. This was ensured when U-shape LA-plates were used, showing an 85% formation efficiency, increasing up to a 98% when it was automatized using the 3D bioprinting technologies. However, sedimentation effect within the cartridge led to a reduction of 20% in size of the spheroid during the printing process. Hyaluronic acid (HA) was chosen as viscosity enhancer to supplement the bioink and overcome cell sedimentation within the cartridge due to the high viability values exhibited by the cells-around 80%-at the used conditions. Finally, (ANCOVA) of spheroid size over time for different printing conditions stand out HA 0.4% (w/v) 60 kDa as the viscosity-improved bioink that exhibit the highest cell viability and spheroid formation percentages. Besides, not only did it ensure cell spheroid homogeneity over time, reducing cell sedimentation effects, but also wider spheroid diameters over time with less variability, outperforming significantly manual loading.

35696306	Three-dimensional (3D) printing and 3D bioprinting are promising technologies for a broad range of healthcare applications from frontier regenerative medicine and tissue engineering therapies to pharmaceutical advancements yet must overcome the challenges of biocompatibility and resolution. Through comparison of traditional biofabrication methods with 3D (bio)printing, this review highlights the promise of 3D printing for the production of on-demand, personalized, and complex products that enhance the accessibility, effectiveness, and safety of drug therapies and delivery systems. In addition, this review describes the capacity of 3D bioprinting to fabricate patient-specific tissues and living cell systems (e.g., vascular networks, organs, muscles, and skeletal systems) as well as its applications in the delivery of cells and genes, microfluidics, and organ-on-chip constructs. This review summarizes how tailoring selected parameters (i.e., accurately selecting the appropriate printing method, materials, and printing parameters based on the desired application and behavior) can better facilitate the development of optimized 3D-printed products and how dynamic 4D-printed strategies (printing materials designed to change with time or stimulus) may be deployed to overcome many of the inherent limitations of conventional 3D-printed technologies. Comprehensive insights into a critical perspective of the future of 4D bioprinting, crucial requirements for 4D printing including the programmability of a material, multimaterial printing methods, and precise designs for meticulous transformations or even clinical applications are also given.

35684380	Three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting is one of the most promising additive manufacturing technologies for fabricating various biomimetic architectures of tissues and organs. In this context, the bioink, a critical element for biofabrication, is a mixture of biomaterials and living cells used in 3D printing to create cell-laden structures. Recently, decellularized extracellular matrix (dECM)-based bioinks derived from natural tissues have garnered enormous attention from researchers due to their unique and complex biochemical properties. This review initially presents the details of the natural ECM and its role in cell growth and metabolism. Further, we briefly emphasize the commonly used decellularization treatment procedures and subsequent evaluations for the quality control of the dECM. In addition, we summarize some of the common bioink preparation strategies, the 3D bioprinting approaches, and the applicability of 3D-printed dECM bioinks to tissue engineering.

35669322	Intimal hyperplasia and restenosis caused by excessive proliferation of smooth muscle cells (SMC) are the main factors for the failure of stent implantation. Drug-eluting stents carried with antiproliferative drugs have emerged as a successful approach to alleviate early neointimal development. However, these agents have been reported to have an undesirable effect on re-endothelialization. In this study, we proposed an integrated bioresorbable stent coated with dipyridamole (DP)-loaded poly(D,L-lactide) (PDLLA) nanofibers. Three-dimensional (3D) bioresorbable stents were fabricated by printing on a rotation mandrel using polycaprolactone (PCL), and the stents were further coated with PDLLA/DP nanofibers. The in vitro degradation and drug release evaluation illustrated the potential for long-term release of DP. Stents coated with PDLLA/DP nanofibers showed excellent hemocompatibility. The cell viability, proliferation, and morphology analysis results revealed that stents coated with PDLLA/DP nanofibers could prevent the proliferation of SMC and have no adverse effects on endothelial cells. The in vivo implantation of stents coated with PDLLA/DP nanofibers showed initial patency and continuous endothelialization and alleviated neointimal formation. The attractive in vitro and in vivo performance indicated its potential for restenosis prevention and endothelialization.	3D-printed Bioresorbable Stent Coated with Dipyridamole-Loaded Nanofiber for Restenosis Prevention and Endothelialization.	2022		Wang Chengjin;Yang Yang;Ji Jingyuan;Fang Yongcong;Ouyang Liliang;Zhang Lei;Sun Wei	Anti-restenosis;Bioresorbable stent;Dipyridamole;Endothelialization;Nanofiber		International journal of bioprinting	"Biomanufacturing Center, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China.;Biomanufacturing and Rapid Forming Technology Key Laboratory of Beijing, Beijing 100084, China.;""Biomanufacturing and Engineering Living Systems"" Innovation International Talents Base (111 Base), Beijing 100084, China.;Biomanufacturing Center, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China.;Biomanufacturing and Rapid Forming Technology Key Laboratory of Beijing, Beijing 100084, China.;""Biomanufacturing and Engineering Living Systems"" Innovation International Talents Base (111 Base), Beijing 100084, China.;Biomanufacturing Center, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China.;Biomanufacturing and Rapid Forming Technology Key Laboratory of Beijing, Beijing 100084, China.;""Biomanufacturing and Engineering Living Systems"" Innovation International Talents Base (111 Base), Beijing 100084, China.;Biomanufacturing Center, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China.;Biomanufacturing and Rapid Forming Technology Key Laboratory of Beijing, Beijing 100084, China.;Biomanufacturing Center, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China.;Biomanufacturing and Rapid Forming Technology Key Laboratory of Beijing, Beijing 100084, China.;""Biomanufacturing and Engineering Living Systems"" Innovation International Talents Base (111 Base), Beijing 100084, China.;Biomanufacturing Center, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China.;Biomanufacturing and Rapid Forming Technology Key Laboratory of Beijing, Beijing 100084, China.;""Biomanufacturing and Engineering Living Systems"" Innovation International Talents Base (111 Base), Beijing 100084, China.;Biomanufacturing Center, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China.;Biomanufacturing and Rapid Forming Technology Key Laboratory of Beijing, Beijing 100084, China.;""Biomanufacturing and Engineering Living Systems"" Innovation International Talents Base (111 Base), Beijing 100084, China."

35660804	Over the last decade, three-dimensional (3D) printing technologies have attracted the interest of researchers due to the possibility of fabricating tissue- and organ-like structures with similarities to the organ of interest. One of the most widely used materials for the fabrication of bioinks is gelatin (Gel) due to its excellent biocompatibility properties. However, in order to fabricate stable scaffolds under physiological conditions, the most common approach is to use gelatin methacrylate (GelMA) that allows the crosslinking and therefore the stabilization of the hydrogel through UV crosslinking. The crosslinking process can be harmful to cells thus decreasing total cell viability. To overcome the need for post-printing crosslinking, a new approach of bioink formulation was studied, incorporating the Fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl diphenylalanine (Fmoc-FF) peptide into the Gel bioink. However, although Fmoc-FF possesses excellent mechanical properties, the lack of elasticity and viscosity makes it unsuitable for 3D-printing. Here, we demonstrate that covalent conjugation of two different ethylene glycol (EG) motifs to the Fmoc-FF peptide increases the hydrophilicity and elasticity properties, which are essential for 3D-printing. This new approach for bioink formulation avoids the need for any post-printing manufacturing processes, such as chemical or UV crosslinking.

35617524	Photoinduced atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) has been proved to be a versatile technique for polymer network formation. However, the slow polymerization rates of typical ATRP limited its application in the field of additive manufacturing (3D printing). In this work, we introduced carbon quantum dots (CQDs) for the first time to the ATRP in aqueous media and developed an ultrafast visible-light-induced polymerization system. After optimization, the polymerization could achieve a high monomer conversion (>90%) within 1 min, and the polydispersity index (PDI) of the polymer was lower than 1.25. This system was then applied as the first example of ATRP for the 3D printing of hydrogel through digital light processing (DLP), and the printed object exhibited good dimensional accuracy. Additionally, the excellent and stable optical properties of CQDs also provided interesting photoluminescence capabilities to the printed objects. We deduce this ATRP mediated 3D printing process would provide a new platform for the preparation of functional and stimuli-responsive hydrogel materials.

35591578	Color 3D printing has widely affected our daily lives; therefore, its precise control is essential for aesthetics and performance. In this study, four unique test plates were printed using powder-based full-color 3D printing as an example; moreover, the corresponding pigment-penetration depth, chromaticity value and image-based metrics were measured to investigate the lateral pigment penetration characteristics and relative surface-color reproduction of each color patch, and to perform an objective analysis with specific microscopic images. The results show that the lateral pigment-penetration depth correlates with the number of printed layers on the designed 3D test plates, and the qualitative analysis of microscopic images can explain the change in chromaticity well. Meanwhile, there is an obvious linear correlation between the mean structural similarity, color-image difference and color difference for current color samples. Thus, our proposed approach has a good practicality for powder-based color 3D printing, and can provide new insight into predicting the color-presentation efficiency of color 3D-printed substrates by the abovementioned objective metrics.

35575323	3D bioprinting of living materials represents an interesting paradigm toward the efficacy enhancement for the biosynthesis of various functional compounds in microorganisms. Previous studies have shown the success of 3D-printed bioactive systems in the production of small molecular compounds. However, the feasibility of such a strategy in producing macromolecules and how the geometry of the 3D scaffold influences the productivity are still unknown. In this study, we printed a series of 3D gelatin-based hydrogels immobilized with fermentation bacteria that can secrete hyaluronic acid (HA), a very useful natural polysaccharide in the fields of biomedicine and tissue engineering. The 3D-printed bioreactor was capable of producing HA, and an elevated yield was obtained with the system bearing a grid structure compared to that either with a solid structure or in a scaffold-free fermentation condition. As for the grid structure, bioreactors with a 90° strut angel and a median interfilament distance displayed the highest HA yield. Our findings highlighted the significant role of 3D printing in the spatial control of microorganism-laden hydrogel structures for the enhancement of biosynthesis efficiency.	3D Bioprinting of Living Materials for Structure-Dependent Production of Hyaluronic Acid.	2022	Apr	Cui Zhenhua;Feng Yanwen;Liu Fei;Jiang Lelun;Yue Jun		Bioprinting;Hyaluronic Acid;Hydrogels;Printing, Three-Dimensional;Tissue Engineering;Tissue Scaffolds	ACS macro letters	School of Biomedical Engineering, Shenzhen Campus of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangming District, Shenzhen, Guangdong 518107, P.

35574057	Fabrication of functional scaffolds for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine applications requires material systems with precise control over cellular performance. 3D printing is a powerful technique to create highly complex and multicomponent structures with well-defined architecture and composition. In this review paper, we explore extrusion-based 3D printing methods (EBP, i.e., Near Field Electrospinning (NFES), Melt Electrowriting (MEW), Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM), and extrusion bioprinting) in terms of their ability to produce scaffolds with bio-instructive properties. These material systems provide spatio-temporal guidance for cells, allowing controlled tissue regeneration and maturation. Multiple physical and biochemical cues introduced to the EBP scaffolds are evaluated in their ability to direct cell alignment, proliferation, differentiation, specific ECM production, and tissue maturation. We indicate that the cues have different impacts depending on the material system, cell type used, or coexistence of multiple cues. Therefore, they must be carefully chosen based on the targeted application. We propose future directions in bio-instructive materials development, including such concepts as metamaterials, hybrid living materials, and 4D printing. The review gathers the knowledge essential for designing new materials with a controlled cellular response, fabrication of advanced engineered tissue, and developing a better understanding of cell biology, especially in response to the biomaterial.	3D printing of bio-instructive materials: Toward directing the cell.	2023	Jan	Zieliński Piotr Stanisław;Gudeti Pavan Kumar Reddy;Rikmanspoel Timo;Włodarczyk-Biegun Małgorzata Katarzyna	3D scaffold;Additive manufacturing;Biomaterials;Cell differentiation;Melt electrowriting;Tissue engineering		Bioactive materials	Polymer Science, Zernike Institute for Advanced Materials, University of Groningen, Nijenborgh 4, 9747 AG, Groningen, the Netherlands.;Biotechnology Centre, The Silesian University of Technology, B.

35566924	Rapid formation of innovative, inexpensive, personalized, and quickly reproducible artery bioresorbable stents (BRSs) is significantly important for treating dangerous and sometimes deadly cerebrovascular disorders. It is greatly challenging to give BRSs excellent mechanical properties, biocompatibility, and bioabsorbability. The current BRSs, which are mostly fabricated from poly-l-lactide (PLLA), are usually applied to coronary revascularization but may not be suitable for cerebrovascular revascularization. Here, novel 3D-printed BRSs for cerebrovascular disease enabling anti-stenosis and gradually disappearing after vessel endothelialization are designed and fabricated by combining biocompatible poly (p-dioxanone) (PPDO) and 3D printing technology for the first time. We can control the strut thickness and vessel coverage of BRSs by adjusting the printing parameters to make the size of BRSs suitable for small-diameter vascular use. We added bis-(2,6-diisopropylphenyl) carbodiimide (commercial name: stabaxol®-1) to PPDO to improve its hydrolytic stability without affecting its mechanical properties and biocompatibility. In vitro cell experiments confirmed that endothelial cells can be conveniently seeded and attached to the BRSs and subsequently demonstrated good proliferation ability. Owing to the excellent mechanical properties of the monofilaments fabricated by the PPDO, the 3D-printed BRSs with PPDO monofilaments support desirable flexibility, therefore offering a novel BRS application in the vascular disorders field.	3D-Printed Poly (P-Dioxanone) Stent for Endovascular Application: In Vitro Evaluations.	2022	Apr	Lu Junlin;Hu Xulin;Yuan Tianyu;Cao Jianfei;Zhao Yuanli;Xiong Chengdong;Li Kainan;Ye Xun;Xu Tao;Zhao Jizong	3D printing;bioresorbable stents;endothelization;intracranial aneurysm;poly (p-dioxanone)		Polymers	Beijing Tiantan Hospital, Department of Neurosurgery, Capital Medical University, Beijing 100070, China.;Clinical Medical College & Affiliated Hospital of Chengdu University, Chengdu University, Chengdu 610081, China.;State Key Laboratory for Turbulence and Complex Systems, Department of Mechanics and Engineering Science, College of Engineering, Peking University, Beijing 100871, China.;School of Materials and Environmental Engineering, Chengdu Technology University, Chengdu 610041, China.;Beijing Tiantan Hospital, Department of Neurosurgery, Capital Medical University, Beijing 100070, China.;Beijing Translational Engineering Enter for 3D Printer in Clinical Neuroscience, Beijing 100070, China.;Chengdu Institute of Organic Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Chengdu 610041, China.;Clinical Medical College & Affiliated Hospital of Chengdu University, Chengdu University, Chengdu 610081, China.;Beijing Tiantan Hospital, Department of Neurosurgery, Capital Medical University, Beijing 100070, China.;Beijing Translational Engineering Enter for 3D Printer in Clinical Neuroscience, Beijing 100070, China.;Department of Mechanical Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China.;Bio-Intelligent Manufacturing and Living Matter Bioprinting Center, Research Institute of Tsinghua University in Shenzhen, Tsinghua University, Shenzhen 518057, China.;East China Institute of Digital Medical Engineering, Shangrao 334000, China.;Beijing Tiantan Hospital, Department of Neurosurgery, Capital Medical University, Beijing 100070, China.;Beijing Translational Engineering Enter for 3D Printer in Clinical Neuroscience, Beijing 100070, China.	generation method and application verification of personalized rehabilitation prescription for patients with balance;Introduced and Jointly Built High-end R&amp;D Institute of Jiangxi Province;Key-Area Research and Development Program of Guangdong Province;National Natural Science Foundation of China;National Key Technology Research and Development Program of the Ministry of Science and Technology of China	School of Materials and Environmental Engineering, Chengdu Technology University, China;State Key Laboratory for Turbulence and Complex Systems, Department of Mechanics and Engineering Science, China;Intelligent Manufacturing and Living Matter Bioprinting Center, Research Institute of Tsinghua University in Shenzhen, China;Tsinghua University, Shenzhen, China;East China Institute of Digital Medical Engineering, Shangrao, China;Chengdu Institute of Organic Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China;Affiliated Hospital of Chengdu University, Chengdu University, China;College of Engineering, Peking University, China;Department of Mechanical Engineering, Tsinghua University, China;D Printer in Clinical Neuroscience, Beijing, China;Beijing Tiantan Hospital, Department of Neurosurgery, China;Capital Medical University, Beijing, China	
35550782	The demand to regenerate biological tissues and organs in patients as an alternative to transplants has motivated the tissue engineering field. Digital light processing (DLP)-based three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting technology enables the rapid fabrication of complex 3D cell-laden scaffolds for tissue engineering applications. Herein, we demonstrate the outstanding printability of photocurable methacrylate-κ-carrageenan (MA-κ-CA) using DLP 3D printing. 3D printed hydrogels with varying concentrations (1-5% w/v) of MA-κ-CA were thoroughly characterized for their swelling, degradation, mechanical, and rheological properties, and suitability for bioprinting with living cells. Viscosity and shear thinning behavior of MA-κ-CA faithfully recapitulate the biomechanical properties of soft human tissues. Encapsulated NIH-3T3 cells show high viability and good proliferation over several days. Furthermore, highly complex 3D hydrogel scaffolds of MA-κ-CA were printed to recapitulate the biological complexity of tissues and organs. This work presents a polysaccharide bioink for preparing tissue scaffolds by DLP 3D bioprinting.

35533922	COVID19 has caused a significant socioeconomic burden worldwide. Opioid crisis was further intensified with the increasing number of opioid overdose/misuse related deaths in last two years. Abusers have adopted newer/efficient methods for manipulating and abusing commercial opioid formulations. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has been strategizing tirelessly to prevent misuse/abuse of prescription opioids. One of the strategies is to develop an abuse deterrent formulation (ADF). The current study aims to develop a novel 3D printed drug-releasing capsule shell filled with an aversion liquid (3D-RECAL). Primarily, metformin hydrochloride (MT, model drug) loaded printable filaments of polyvinyl alcohol was prepared using hot melt extrusion. Following extrusion, a 3D printed capsule shell was designed and fabricated using a single nozzle fuse deposition modelling 3D printer. An aversion liquid to be filled in 3D-RECAL capsules was prepared by combining sudan black and sodium polyacrylamide starch in oil base. Mechanical analysis of extruded filaments suggested that the filaments with 20%w/w MT had a higher mechanical strength compared to other drug loadings. Instantaneous gelling and large black non-snortable particles were formed during solvent extraction and physical manipulation studies, respectively. Due to the drug being embedded in the capsule shell, MT release was immediately started with >85% of MT release within 45 mins in 0.1 N HCl. Due to the everlasting need for the newer efficient ADF technologies, 3D-RECAL can be a step in the right direction towards saving lives, providing safe and effective measures to deterring abusers.

35525763	Bioprinting - printing with incorporated living cells - has earned special attention on tissue engineering approaches, aiming to closer reproduce the 3D microenvironment of the target tissue. However, it raises extra complexity related to the need to use cell-friendly printing conditions that still comply with material printing fidelity. Inspired by the composite nano structural organization of mineralized tissues, this work reports the efficiency of the chemical approach followed to in situ mineralize blue shark skin collagen, at a nano scale level, to ultimately produce stable inks. The influence of initial cellular density was evaluated by assessing three different concentrations (2.5, 5 and 7.5 × 106 cells·ml-1) of human adipose stem cells (hASC), with the higher density of encapsulated cells presenting improved viability in a long culture term. Immunodetection of osteogenic-related markers, like RUNX2 and osteopontin, 21 days after cell culture in basal conditions confirmed the potential of the ink to be applied for osteogenic purposes, which may be associated with the success of the cell-to-ink interaction and the Ca2+ ions released from the co-precipitated hydroxyapatite. A combination of mineralized shark collagen, alginate and hASC is thus proposed as a bioactive bioink with potential properties for regeneration of bone tissue.

35500394	Developing an injectable anisotropic scaffold with precisely topographic cues to induce 3D cellular organization plays a critical role in volumetric muscle loss (VML) repair in vivo. However, controlling aligned myofiber regeneration in vivo based on previous injectable scaffolds continues to prove challenging, especially in a 3D configuration. Herein, we prepare the monodisperse remote magnetic controlled short nanofibers (MSNFs) with a high yield using an advanced coaxial electrospinning-cyrocutting method. An injectable anisotropic MSNF/Gel nanofiber/hydrogel scaffold based on MSNFs within photocurable hydrogel is further designed, showing the ability to guide 3D cellular alignment and organization by the precise microarchitecture control via a remote magnetic field. MSNF/Gel anisotropic scaffolds were able to recreate the macroscale and microscale topographical features of orbicular muscle and bipennate muscle mimicking their anatomical locations. Furthermore, the resultant MSNF/Gel anisotropic scaffolds significantly enhanced aligned myofiber formation in vivo and improved functional recovery of injured muscles in animal VML models. In summary, this approach offers a new promising tissue engineering strategy not only for the aligned myofiber formation for enhancing skeletal muscle regeneration in vivo but also for other biofabrication of living constructs containing complex anisotropy in vitro.

35480972	Treating large bone defects, known as critical-sized defects (CSDs), is challenging because they are not spontaneously healed by the patient's body. Due to the limitations associated with conventional bone grafts, bone tissue engineering (BTE), based on three-dimensional (3D) bioprinted scaffolds, has emerged as a promising approach for bone reconstitution and treatment. Bioprinting technology allows for incorporation of living cells and/or growth factors into scaffolds aiming to mimic the structure and properties of the native bone. To date, a wide range of biomaterials (either natural or synthetic polymers), as well as various cells and growth factors, have been explored for use in scaffold bioprinting. However, a key challenge that remains is the fabrication of scaffolds that meet structure, mechanical, and osteoconductive requirements of native bone and support vascularization. In this review, we briefly present the latest developments and discoveries of CSD treatment by means of bioprinted scaffolds, with a focus on the biomaterials, cells, and growth factors for formulating bioinks and their bioprinting techniques. Promising state-of-the-art pathways or strategies recently developed for bioprinting bone scaffolds are highlighted, including the incorporation of bioactive ceramics to create composite scaffolds, the use of advanced bioprinting technologies (e.g., core/shell bioprinting) to form hybrid scaffolds or systems, as well as the rigorous design of scaffolds by taking into account of the influence of such parameters as scaffold pore geometry and porosity. We also review in-vitro assays and in-vivo models to track bone regeneration, followed by a discussion of current limitations associated with 3D bioprinting technologies for BTE. We conclude this review with emerging approaches in this field, including the development of gradient scaffolds, four-dimensional (4D) printing technology via smart materials, organoids, and cell aggregates/spheroids along with future avenues for related BTE.	3D Bioprinted Scaffolds for Bone Tissue Engineering: State-Of-The-Art and Emerging Technologies.	2022		Yazdanpanah Zahra;Johnston James D;Cooper David M L;Chen Xiongbiao	3D printing;bioprinting;bone tissue engineering;critical-sized defect;scaffold		Frontiers in bioengineering and biotechnology	Division of Biomedical Engineering, College of Engineering, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, SK, Canada.;Division of Biomedical Engineering, College of Engineering, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, SK, Canada.;Department of Mechanical Engineering, College of Engineering, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, SK, Canada.;Department of Anatomy Physiology and Pharmacology, College of Medicine, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, SK, Canada.;Division of Biomedical Engineering, College of Engineering, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, SK, Canada.;Department of Mechanical Engineering, College of Engineering, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, SK, Canada.

35477166	Hydrogels, three-dimensional (3D) networks of hydrophilic polymers formed in water, are a significant type of soft matter used in fundamental and applied sciences. Hydrogels are of particular interest for biomedical applications, owing to their soft elasticity and good biocompatibility. However, the high water content and soft nature of hydrogels often make it difficult to process them into desirable solid forms. The development of 3D printing (3DP) technologies has provided opportunities for the manufacturing of hydrogels, by adopting a freeform fabrication method. Owing to its high printing speed and resolution, vat photopolymerization 3DP has recently attracted considerable interest for hydrogel fabrication, with digital light processing (DLP) becoming a widespread representative technique. Whilst acknowledging that other types of vat photopolymerization 3DP have also been applied for this purpose, we here only focus on DLP and its derivatives. In this review, we first comprehensively outline the most recent advances in both materials and fabrication, including the adaptation of novel hydrogel systems and advances in processing (e.g. volumetric printing and multimaterial integration). Secondly, we summarize the applications of hydrogel DLP, including regenerative medicine, functional microdevices, and soft robotics. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that either of these specific review focuses has been adopted in the literature. More importantly, we discuss the major challenges associated with hydrogel DLP and provide our perspectives on future trends. To summarize, this review aims to aid and inspire other researchers investigatng DLP, photocurable hydrogels, and the research fields related to them.

35466222	Extrusion bioprinting is an emerging technology to apply biomaterials precisely with living cells (referred to as bioink) layer by layer to create three-dimensional (3D) functional constructs for tissue engineering. Printability and cell viability are two critical issues in the extrusion bioprinting process; printability refers to the capacity to form and maintain reproducible 3D structure and cell viability characterizes the amount or percentage of survival cells during printing. Research reveals that both printability and cell viability can be affected by various parameters associated with the construct design, bioinks, and bioprinting process. This paper briefly reviews the literature with the aim to identify the affecting parameters and highlight the methods or strategies for rigorously determining or optimizing them for improved printability and cell viability. This paper presents the review and discussion mainly from experimental, computational, and machine learning (ML) views, given their promising in this field. It is envisioned that ML will be a powerful tool to advance bioprinting for tissue engineering.

35448140	The past a few decades have seen exponential growth in the field of regenerative medicine. What began as extirpative (complete tissue or organ removal), with little regard to the effects of tissue loss and/or disfigurement, has evolved towards fabricating engineered tissues using personalized living cells (e.g., stem cells), and customizing a matrix or structural organization to support and guide tissue development. Biofabrication, largely accomplished through three-dimensional (3D) printing technology, provides precise, controlled, and layered assemblies of cells and biomaterials, emulating the heterogenous microenvironment of the in vivo tissue architecture. This review provides a concise framework for the bio-manufacturing process and addresses the contributions of hydrogels to biological modeling. The versatility of hydrogels in bioprinting is detailed along with an extensive elaboration of their physical, mechanical, and biological properties, as well as their assets and limitations in bioprinting. The scope of various hydrogels in tissue formation has been discussed through the case studies of biofabricated 3D constructs in order to provide the readers with a glimpse into the barrier-breaking accomplishments of biomedical sciences. In the end, the restraints of bioprinting itself are discussed, accompanied with the identification of available engineering strategies to overcome them.

35411836	Bioprinting using cell-laden bioink is a rapidly emerging additive manufacturing method to fabricate engineered tissue constructs and in vitro models of disease biology. Amongst different bioprinting modalities, extrusion-based bioprinting is the most conveniently adopted technique due to its affordability. Bioinks consisting of living cells are suspended in hydrogels and extruded through syringe-needle assemblies, which subsequently undergo gelation at the collector plate. During the process, pressure is exerted on living cells which may cause cell deaths. Thus, for selected combination of cell and hydrogel, exerted pressure and the extrusion play key roles in determining the cell viability. Experimental evaluation to characterise stresses experienced by the cells in a bioink during bioprinting is a tedious exercise. Herein, computational modelling can be applied efficiently for rapid screening of bioinks. In the present study, a smoothed particle hydrodynamics model is developed for the analysis of stresses exerted on the cells during bioprinting process. Cells are modelled by assigning different mechanical properties to nucleus, cytoskeleton and cell membrane regions of the cell to get a more realistic understanding of cell deformation. The cytoplasm and nucleus are modelled as finite element meshes and a spring model of the cell membrane is coupled to the finite element model to develop a three-compartment model of the cell. Cell deformation is taken as a potential indicator of cell death. Effect of different process parameters such as flow rate, syringe-nozzle geometry and cell density are investigated. A submodeling approach is further introduced to predict deformation with higher resolution in a unit volume containing 104 to 108 cells. Results suggest that the generated bioink flow dynamic model can be a useful tool for the computational study of fluid flow involving cell suspensions during a bioprinting process.

35410416	Macroscale additive manufacturing has seen significant advances recently, but these advances are not yet realized for the bottom-up formation of nanoscale polymeric features. We describe a platform technology for creating crosslinked polymer features using rapid surface-initiated crosslinking and versatile macrocrosslinkers, delivered by a microfluidic-coupled atomic force microscope known as FluidFM. A crosslinkable polymer containing norbornene moieties is delivered to a catalyzed substrate where polymerization occurs, resulting in extremely rapid chemical curing of the delivered material. Due to the living crosslinking reaction, construction of lines and patterns with multiple layers is possible, showing quantitative material addition from each deposition in a method analogous to fused filament fabrication, but at the nanoscale. Print parameters influenced printed line dimensions, with the smallest lines being 450 nm across with a vertical layer resolution of 2 nm. This nanoscale 3D printing platform of reactive polymer materials has applications for device fabrication, optical systems and biotechnology.	3D nanoprinting via spatially controlled assembly and polymerization.	2022	Apr	Pattison Thomas G;Wang Shuo;Miller Robert D;Liu Gang-Yu;Qiao Greg G		Polymerization;Polymers;Printing, Three-Dimensional;Technology	Nature communications	Polymer Science Group, Department of Chemical Engineering, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, 3010, Australia.;Department of Chemistry, University of California, Davis, CA, 95616, USA.;International Business Machines-Almaden Research Center, 650 Harry Road, San Jose, CA, 95120, USA.;Department of Chemistry, University of California, Davis, CA, 95616, USA. gyliu@ucdavis.edu.;Polymer Science Group, Department of Chemical Engineering, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, 3010, Australia. gregghq@unimelb.edu.au.

35407727	3D printing has opened exciting new opportunities for the in vitro fabrication of biocompatible hybrid pseudo-tissues. Technologies based on additive manufacturing herald a near future when patients will receive therapies delivering functional tissue substitutes for the repair of their musculoskeletal tissue defects. In particular, bone tissue engineering (BTE) might extensively benefit from such an approach. However, designing an optimal 3D scaffold with adequate stiffness and biodegradability properties also guaranteeing the correct cell adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation, is still a challenge. The aim of this work was the rewiring of a commercial fuse deposition modeling (FDM) 3D printer into a 3D bioplotter, aiming at obtaining scaffold fiber thickness and porosity control during its manufacturing. Although it is well-established that FDM is a fast and low-price technology, the high temperatures required for printing lead to limitations in the biomaterials that can be used. In our hands, modifying the printing head of the FDM device with a custom-made holder has allowed to print hydrogels commonly used for embedding living cells. The results highlight a good resolution, reproducibility and repeatability of alginate/gelatin scaffolds obtained via our custom 3D bioplotter prototype, showing a viable strategy to equip a small-medium laboratory with an instrument for manufacturing good-quality 3D scaffolds for cell culture and tissue engineering applications.

35406319	The increasing trend of the use of synthetic products may result in an increased level of pollution affecting both the environment and living organisms. Therefore, from the sustainability point of view, natural, renewable and biodegradable materials are urgently needed to replace environmentally harmful synthetic materials. Jute, one of the natural fibers, plays a vital role in developing composite materials that showed potential in a variety of applications such as household, automotive and medical appliances. This paper first reviews the characterization and performance of jute fibers. Subsequently, the main focus is shifted towards research advancements in enhancing physical, mechanical, thermal and tribological properties of the polymeric materials (i.e., synthetic or biobased and thermoplastic or thermoset plastic) reinforced with jute fibers in a variety of forms such as particle, short fiber or woven fabric. It is understood that the physio-mechanical properties of jute-polymer composites largely vary based on the fiber processing and treatment, fiber shape and/or size, fabrication processes, fiber volume fraction, layering sequence within the matrix, interaction of the fiber with the matrix and the matrix materials used. Furthermore, the emerging research on jute fiber, such as nanomaterials from jute, bioplastic packaging, heavy metal absorption, electronics, energy device or medical applications and development of jute fiber composites with 3D printing, is explored. Finally, the key challenges for jute and its derivative products in gaining commercial successes have been highlighted and potential future directions are discussed.

35387266	Three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting has been extensively explored for tissue repair and regeneration, while the insufficient nutrient and oxygen availability in the printed constructs, as well as the lack of adaptive dimensions and shapes, compromises the overall therapeutic efficacy and limits their further application. Herein, inspired by the natural symbiotic relationship between salamanders and algae, we present novel living photosynthetic scaffolds by using an in situ microfluidic-assisted 3D bioprinting strategy for adapting irregular-shaped wounds and promoting their healing. As the oxygenic photosynthesis unicellular microalga (Chlorella pyrenoidosa) was incorporated during 3D printing, the generated scaffolds could produce sustainable oxygen under light illumination, which facilitated the cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation even in hypoxic conditions. Thus, when the living microalgae-laden scaffolds were directly printed into diabetic wounds, they could significantly accelerate the chronic wound closure by alleviating local hypoxia, increasing angiogenesis, and promoting extracellular matrix (ECM) synthesis. These results indicate that the in situ bioprinting of living photosynthetic microalgae offers an effective autotrophic biosystem for promoting wound healing, suggesting a promising therapeutic strategy for diverse tissue engineering applications.

35386332	The conventional approach for fabricating polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microfluidic devices is a lengthy and inconvenient procedure and may require a clean-room microfabrication facility often not readily available. Furthermore, living cells can't survive the oxygen-plasma and high-temperature-baking treatments required for covalent bonding to assemble multiple PDMS parts into a leak-free device, and it is difficult to disassemble the devices because of the irreversible covalent bonding. As a result, seeding/loading cells into and retrieving cells from the devices are challenging. Here, we discovered that decreasing the curing agent for crosslinking the PDMS prepolymer increases the noncovalent binding energy of the resultant PDMS surfaces without plasma or any other treatment. This enables convenient fabrication of leak-free microfluidic devices by noncovalent binding for various biomedical applications that require high pressure/flow rates and/or long-term cell culture, by simply hand-pressing the PDMS parts without plasma or any other treatment to bind/assemble. With this method, multiple types of cells can be conveniently loaded into specific areas of the PDMS parts before assembly and due to the reversible nature of the noncovalent bonding, the assembled device can be easily disassembled by hand peeling for retrieving cells. Combining with 3D printers that are widely available for making masters to eliminate the need of photolithography, this facile yet rigorous fabrication approach is much faster and more convenient for making PDMS microfluidic devices than the conventional oxygen plasma-baking-based irreversible covalent bonding method.

35349260	Bioprinting of engineered bacteria is of great interest for applications of synthetic biology in the context of living biomaterials, but so far, only a few viable approaches are available for the printing of gels hosting live Escherichia coli bacteria. Here, we develop a gentle extrusion-based bioprinting method based on an inexpensive alginate/agarose ink mixture that enables printing of E. coli into three-dimensional hydrogel structures up to 10 mm in height. We first characterize the rheological properties of the gel ink and then study the growth of the bacteria inside printed structures. We show that the maturation of fluorescent proteins deep within the printed structures can be facilitated by the addition of a calcium peroxide-based oxygen generation system. We then utilize the bioprinter to control different types of interactions between bacteria that depend on their spatial position. We next show quorum-sensing-based chemical communication between the engineered sender and receiver bacteria placed at different positions inside the bioprinted structure and finally demonstrate the fabrication of barrier structures defined by nonmotile bacteria that can guide the movement of chemotactic bacteria inside a gel. We anticipate that a combination of 3D bioprinting and synthetic biological approaches will lead to the development of living biomaterials containing engineered bacteria as dynamic functional units.

In proof-of-concept experiments, we identified the optimum working concentrations of the surface coating, characterized the specificity of protein binding and demonstrated the suitability of this approach by subcellular micropatterning experiments in living cells.

35323260	Hydrogel, a special system of polymer solutions, can be obtained through the physical/chemical/enzymic crosslinking of polymer chains in a water-based dispersion medium. Different compositions and crosslinking methods endow hydrogel with diverse physicochemical properties. Those hydrogels with suitable physicochemical properties hold manifold functions in biomedical fields, such as cell transplantation, tissue engineering, organ manufacturing, drug releasing and pathological model analysis. In this study, several alginate-based composite hydrogels, including gelatin/alginate (G-A), gelatin/alginate/agarose (G-A-A), fibrinogen/alginate (F-A), fibrinogen/alginate/agarose (F-A-A) and control alginate (A) and alginate/agarose (A-A), were constructed. We researched the advantages and disadvantages of these hydrogels in terms of their microscopic structure (cell living space), water holding capacity, swelling rate, swelling-erosion ratio, mechanical properties and biocompatibility. Briefly, alginate-based hydrogels can be used for three-dimensional (3D) cell culture alone. However, when mixed with other natural polymers in different proportions, a relatively stable network with a good cytocompatibility, mechanical strength and water holding capacity can be formed. The physical and chemical properties of the hydrogels can be adjusted by changing the composition, proportion and cross-linking methods of the polymers. Conclusively, the G-A-A and F-A-A hydrogels are the best hydrogels for the in vitro 3D cell cultures and pathological model construction.

35296051	3D bio-printing is an emerging technology to fabricate tissue scaffold in-vitro through the controlled allocation of biomaterial and cells, which can mimic the in-vivo counterpart of living tissue. Live cells are often encapsulated into the biomaterials (i.e., bio-ink) and extruded by controlling the printing parameters. The functionality of the bioink depends upon three factors: (a) printability, (b) shape fidelity, and (c) bio-compatibility. Increasing viscosity will improve the printability and the shape fidelity but require higher applied extrusion pressure, which is detrimental to the living cell dwelling in the bio-ink, which is often ignored in the bio-ink optimization process. This paper demonstrates a roadmap to develop and optimize bio-inks, ensuring printability, shape fidelity, and cell survivability. The pressure exerted on the bio-ink during extrusion processes is measured analytically, and the information is incorporated in the bio-ink's rheology design. Cell-laden filaments are fabricated with multiple cell lines, i.e., Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK 293), BxPC3, and prostate cancer cells which are analyzed for cell viability. The cross-sectional live-dead assay of the extruded filament demonstrates a spatial pattern for HEK 293 cell viability, which correlates with our analytical finding of the shear stress at the nozzle tip. All three cell lines were able to sustain a transient shear stress of 3.7 kPa and demonstrate 90% viability with our designed bio-ink after 15 days of incubation. Simultaneously, the shape fidelity and printability matrices show its suitability for 3D bio-printing process.

35270874	The increasing air pollution across the globe has given rise to a global health crisis that is increasing at an alarming rate. Every year, millions of people lose their lives due to health risks caused by air pollutants. Hence, there is a pressing need for better solutions to accurately measure the amount of air pollution. This work is aimed at designing a highly compact, accurate, low-cost, self-resettable, and easy-to-use gravimetric-based particulate matter sensor solution for portable applications. Previous attempts have failed to realize true miniaturization, due to the size constraints of the virtual impactor needed-a mechanism that segregates the particulate matters based on their sizes. Our complete particulate matter sensor solution consists of three components (i) a piezoelectric resonating membrane, (ii) a virtual impactor, and (iii) a thermophoretic mechanism to reset the sensor. This paper presents a novel design of the virtual impactor, based on a folded configuration. This helps realize the entire system in a volume of 20 mm × 20 mm × 10 mm. We report here the design, working principles, fabrication, and experimental results of the virtual impactor.

35267843	Tissue engineering (TE) is an innovative approach to tackling many diseases and body parts that need to be replaced by developing artificial tissues and organs. Bioinks play an important role in the success of various TE applications. A bioink refers to a combination of a living cell, biomaterials, and bioactive molecules deposited in a layer-by-layer form to fabricate tissue-like structures. The research on bioink attempts to offer a 3D complex architecture and control cellular behavior that improve cell physical properties and viability. This research proposed a new multi-material bioink based on alginate (A), gelatin (G), and cholesteryl ester liquid crystals (CELC) biomaterials, namely (AGLC) bioinks. The development of AGLC was initiated with the optimization of different concentrations of A and G gels to obtain a printable formulation of AG gels. Subsequently, the influences of different concentrations of CELC with AG gels were investigated by using a microextrusion-based 3D bioprinting system to obtain a printed structure with high shape fidelity and minimum width. The AGLC bioinks were formulated using AG gel with 10% weight/volume (w/v) of A and 50% w/v G (AG10:50) and 1%, 5%, 10%, 20%, and 40% of CELC, respectively. The AGLC bioinks yield a high printability and resolution blend. The printed filament has a minimum width of 1.3 mm at a 1 mL/min extrusion rate when the A equals 10% w/v, G equals 50% w/v, and CELC equals 40% v/v (AGLC40). Polymerization of the AGLC bioinks with calcium (Ca2+) ions shows well-defined and more stable structures in the post-printing process. The physicochemical and viability properties of the AGLC bioinks were examined by FTIR, DSC, contact angle, FESEM, MTT assay, and cell interaction evaluation methods. The FTIR spectra of the AGLC bioinks exhibit a combination of characteristics vibrations of AG10:50 and CELC. The DSC analysis indicates the high thermal stability of the bioinks. Wettability analysis shows a reduction in the water absorption ability of the AGLC bioinks. FESEM analysis indicates that the surface morphologies of the bioinks exhibit varying microstructures.

35267835	Wounds are a major health concern affecting the lives of millions of people. Some wounds may pass a threshold diameter to become unrecoverable by themselves. These wounds become chronic and may even lead to mortality. Recently, 3D printing technology, in association with biocompatible hydrogels, has emerged as a promising platform for developing smart wound dressings, overcoming several challenges. 3D printed wound dressings can be loaded with a variety of items, such as antibiotics, antibacterial nanoparticles, and other drugs that can accelerate wound healing rate. 3D printing is computerized, allowing each level of the printed part to be fully controlled in situ to produce the dressings desired. In this review, recent developments in hydrogel-based wound dressings made using 3D printing are covered. The most common biosensors integrated with 3D printed hydrogels for wound dressing applications are comprehensively discussed. Fundamental challenges for 3D printing and future prospects are highlighted. Additionally, some related nanomaterial-based hydrogels are recommended for future consideration.

35257786	3D bioprinting - the fabrication of geometrically complex 3D structures from biocompatible materials containing living cells using additive manufacturing technologies - is a rapidly developing research field with a broad range of potential applications in fundamental research, regenerative medicine and industry. Currently, research into 3D bioprinting is mostly focused on new therapeutic concepts for the treatment of injured or degenerative tissue by fabrication of functional tissue equivalents or disease models, utilizing mammalian cells. However, 3D bioprinting also has an enormous potential in biotechnology. Due to the defined spatial arrangement of biologically active (non-mammalian) cells in a biomaterial matrix, reaction compartments can be designed according to specific needs, or co-cultures of different cell types can be realized in a highly organized manner to exploit cell-cell interactions. Thus, 3D bioprinting technology can enable new biotechnological concepts, for example, by implementing perfusion systems while protecting shear sensitive cells or performing cascaded bioreactions. Here, we review the use of 3D bioprinting to manufacture defined 3D microenvironments for biotechnological applications using bacteria, fungi, microalgae, plant cells and co-cultures of different cell types. We discuss recent approaches to apply 3D bioprinting in biotechnological applications and - as it is a particular challenge - concepts for the real-time monitoring of the physiological state, growth and metabolic activity of the embedded cells in 3D bioprinted constructs. With these insights, we outline new applications of 3D bioprinting in biotechnology, engineered living materials and space research.

35235846	Historically, biofilms have been perceived as problematic or detrimental. However, biofilms possess favorable traits such as self-regeneration, sustainability, scalability, and tunability, which make them candidates for diverse applications. Traditional applications of biofilms, such as environmental remediation, bioleaching, microbial fuel cells, and corrosion protection, are often built on the basis of wild-type or metabolically engineered strains. In this review, we further comment on the design strategies for multiple innovative applications of living functional biofilms. With the integration of signaling pathways, engineering of metabolic pathways and modification of extracellular polymeric substances, living functional biofilms have been constructed by researchers through various strategies. Functional biofilms for diverse applications, including catalysis, electric conduction, bioremediation, and medical therapy have been demonstrated in the literature. The mechanical properties of biofilms can be tuned through genetic editing, metal ion curing and synthetic gene circuits, etc. In addition, the improvement of 3D printing to use bioinks has also achieved significant progresses in fabricating living functional biofilms with specific structures. In the future, the combination of synthetic biology and techniques from other disciplines will lead to practical large-scale applications of biofilms.

35194975	A challenge for bioprinting tissue constructs is enabling the viability and functionality of encapsulated cells. Rationally designed bioink that can create appropriate biophysical cues shows great promise for overcoming such challenges. Here, a nanoparticle-stabilized emulsion bioink for direct fabrication of porous tissue constructs by digital light processing based 3D bioprinting technology is introduced. The emulsion bioink is integrated by the mixture of aqueous dextran microdroplets and gelatin methacryloyl solution and is further rendered stable by β-lactoglobulin nanoparticles. After bioprinting, the printed tissue constructs create the macroporous structure via removal of dextran, thereby providing favorable biophysical cues to promote the viability, proliferation, and spreading of the encapsulated cells. Moreover, a trachea-shaped construct containing chondrocytes is bioprinted and implanted in vivo. The results demonstrate that the generated macroporous construct is of benefit to cartilage tissue rebuilding. This work offers an advanced bioink for the fabrication of living tissue constructs by activating the cell behaviors and functions in situ and can lead to the development of 3D bioprinting.

35166410	Organ- and tissue-level biological functions are intimately linked to microscale cell-cell interactions and to the overarching tissue architecture. Together, biofabrication and organoid technologies offer the unique potential to engineer multi-scale living constructs, with cellular microenvironments formed by stem cell self-assembled structures embedded in customizable bioprinted geometries. This study introduces the volumetric bioprinting of complex organoid-laden constructs, which capture key functions of the human liver. Volumetric bioprinting via optical tomography shapes organoid-laden gelatin hydrogels into complex centimeter-scale 3D structures in under 20 s. Optically tuned bioresins enable refractive index matching of specific intracellular structures, countering the disruptive impact of cell-mediated light scattering on printing resolution. This layerless, nozzle-free technique poses no harmful mechanical stresses on organoids, resulting in superior viability and morphology preservation post-printing. Bioprinted organoids undergo hepatocytic differentiation showing albumin synthesis, liver-specific enzyme activity, and remarkably acquired native-like polarization. Organoids embedded within low stiffness gelatins (<2 kPa) are bioprinted into mathematically defined lattices with varying degrees of pore network tortuosity, and cultured under perfusion. These structures act as metabolic biofactories in which liver-specific ammonia detoxification can be enhanced by the architectural profile of the constructs. This technology opens up new possibilities for regenerative medicine and personalized drug testing.

35163687	It has been observed that bone fractures carry a risk of high mortality and morbidity. The deployment of a proper bone healing method is essential to achieve the desired success. Over the years, bone tissue engineering (BTE) has appeared to be a very promising approach aimed at restoring bone defects. The main role of the BTE is to apply new, efficient, and functional bone regeneration therapy via a combination of bone scaffolds with cells and/or healing promotive factors (e.g., growth factors and bioactive agents). The modern approach involves also the production of living bone grafts in vitro by long-term culture of cell-seeded biomaterials, often with the use of bioreactors. This review presents the most recent findings concerning biomaterials, cells, and techniques used for the production of living bone grafts under in vitro conditions. Particular attention has been given to features of known bioreactor systems currently used in BTE: perfusion bioreactors, rotating bioreactors, and spinner flask bioreactors. Although bioreactor systems are still characterized by some limitations, they are excellent platforms to form bioengineered living bone grafts in vitro for bone fracture regeneration. Moreover, the review article also describes the types of biomaterials and sources of cells that can be used in BTE as well as the role of three-dimensional bioprinting and pulsed electromagnetic fields in both bone healing and BTE.

35142351	The zebrafish has become a widely used animal model due, in large part, to its accessibility to and usefulness for high-resolution optical imaging. Although zebrafish research has historically focused mostly on early development, in recent years the fish has increasingly been used to study regeneration, cancer metastasis, behavior and other processes taking place in juvenile and adult animals. However, imaging of live adult zebrafish is extremely challenging, with survival of adult fish limited to a few tens of minutes using standard imaging methods developed for zebrafish embryos and larvae. Here, we describe a new method for imaging intubated adult zebrafish using a specially designed 3D printed chamber for long-term imaging of adult zebrafish on inverted microscope systems. We demonstrate the utility of this new system by nearly day-long observation of neutrophil recruitment to a wound area in living double-transgenic adult casper zebrafish with fluorescently labeled neutrophils and lymphatic vessels, as well as intubating and imaging the same fish repeatedly. We also show that Mexican cavefish can be intubated and imaged in the same way, demonstrating this method can be used for long-term imaging of adult animals from diverse aquatic species.

35130780	A recent and quite promising technique for bone tissue engineering is the 3D printing, peculiarly regarding the production of high-quality scaffolds. The 3D printed scaffold strictly provides suitable characteristics for living cells, in order to induce treatment, reconstruction and substitution of injured tissue. The purpose of this work was to evaluate the behavior of the 3D scaffold based on Poly(L-co-D,L lactic acid-co-Trimethylene Carbonate) (PLDLA-TMC), which was designed in Solidworks™ software, projected in 3D Slicer™, 3D printed in filament extrusion, cultured with mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and tested in vitro and in vivo models. For in vitro study, the MSCs were seeded in a PLDLA-TMC 3D scaffold with 600 μm pore size and submitted to proliferation and osteogenic differentiation. The in vivo assays implanted the PLDLA-TMC scaffolds with or without MSCs in the calvaria of Wistar rats submitted to 8 mm cranial bone defect, in periods of 8-12 weeks. The results showed that PLDLA-TMC 3D scaffolds favored adherence and cell growth, and suggests an osteoinductive activity, which means that the material itself augmented cellular differentiation. The implanted PLDLA-TMC containing MSCs, showed better results after 12 weeks prior grafting, due the absence of inflammatory processes, enlarged regeneration of bone tissue and facilitated angiogenesis. Notwithstanding, the 3D PLDLA-TMC itself implanted enriched tissue repair; the addition of cells known to upregulate tissue healing reinforce the perspectives for the PLDLA-TMC applications in the field of bone tissue engineering in clinical trials.

35108023	Soft robotics greatly benefits from nature as a source of inspiration, introducing innate means of safe interaction between robotic appliances and living organisms. In contrast, the materials involved are often nonbiodegradable or stem from nonrenewable resources, contributing to an ever-growing environmental footprint. Furthermore, conventional manufacturing methods, such as mold casting, are not suitable for replicating or imitating the complexity of nature's creations. Consequently, the inclusion of sustainability concepts alongside the development of new fabrication procedures is required. We report a customized 3D-printing process based on fused deposition modeling, printing a fully biodegradable gelatin-based hydrogel (biogel) ink into dimensionally stable, complex objects. This process enables fast and cost-effective prototyping of resilient, soft robotic applications from gels that stretch to six times their original length, as well as an accessible recycling procedure with zero waste. We present printed pneumatic actuators performing omnidirectional movement at fast response times (less than a second), featuring integrated 3D-printed stretchable waveguides, capable of both proprio- and exteroception. These soft devices are endowed with dynamic real-time control capable of automated search-and-wipe routines to detect and remove obstacles. They can be reprinted several times or disposed of hazard-free at the end of their lifetime, potentially unlocking a sustainable future for soft robotics.	3D printing of resilient biogels for omnidirectional and exteroceptive soft actuators.	2022	Feb	Heiden A;Preninger D;Lehner L;Baumgartner M;Drack M;Woritzka E;Schiller D;Gerstmayr R;Hartmann F;Kaltenbrunner M		Biocompatible Materials;Biomimetic Materials;Equipment Design;Gelatin;Humans;Hydrogels;Ink;Optical Phenomena;Printing, Three-Dimensional;Robotics;Tensile Strength	Science robotics	Division of Soft Matter Physics, Institute of Experimental Physics Johannes Kepler University Linz, Altenbergerstr. 69, Linz, Austria.;Soft Materials Lab, Linz Institute of Technology, Johannes Kepler University Linz, Altenbergerstr. 69, Linz, Austria.;Division of Soft Matter Physics, Institute of Experimental Physics Johannes Kepler University Linz, Altenbergerstr. 69, Linz, Austria.;Soft Materials Lab, Linz Institute of Technology, Johannes Kepler University Linz, Altenbergerstr. 69, Linz, Austria.;Division of Soft Matter Physics, Institute of Experimental Physics Johannes Kepler University Linz, Altenbergerstr. 69, Linz, Austria.;Soft Materials Lab, Linz Institute of Technology, Johannes Kepler University Linz, Altenbergerstr. 69, Linz, Austria.;Division of Soft Matter Physics, Institute of Experimental Physics Johannes Kepler University Linz, Altenbergerstr. 69, Linz, Austria.;Soft Materials Lab, Linz Institute of Technology, Johannes Kepler University Linz, Altenbergerstr. 69, Linz, Austria.;Institute of Polymer Science, Johannes Kepler University Linz, Altenbergerstr. 69, Linz, Austria.;Division of Soft Matter Physics, Institute of Experimental Physics Johannes Kepler University Linz, Altenbergerstr. 69, Linz, Austria.;Soft Materials Lab, Linz Institute of Technology, Johannes Kepler University Linz, Altenbergerstr. 69, Linz, Austria.;Division of Soft Matter Physics, Institute of Experimental Physics Johannes Kepler University Linz, Altenbergerstr. 69, Linz, Austria.;Soft Materials Lab, Linz Institute of Technology, Johannes Kepler University Linz, Altenbergerstr. 69, Linz, Austria.;Division of Soft Matter Physics, Institute of Experimental Physics Johannes Kepler University Linz, Altenbergerstr. 69, Linz, Austria.;Soft Materials Lab, Linz Institute of Technology, Johannes Kepler University Linz, Altenbergerstr. 69, Linz, Austria.;Soft Materials Lab, Linz Institute of Technology, Johannes Kepler University Linz, Altenbergerstr. 69, Linz, Austria.;Institute of Polymer Science, Johannes Kepler University Linz, Altenbergerstr. 69, Linz, Austria.;Division of Soft Matter Physics, Institute of Experimental Physics Johannes Kepler University Linz, Altenbergerstr. 69, Linz, Austria.;Soft Materials Lab, Linz Institute of Technology, Johannes Kepler University Linz, Altenbergerstr. 69, Linz, Austria.;Division of Soft Matter Physics, Institute of Experimental Physics Johannes Kepler University Linz, Altenbergerstr. 69, Linz, Austria.;Soft Materials Lab, Linz Institute of Technology, Johannes Kepler University Linz, Altenbergerstr. 69, Linz, Austria.

35106374	Patterning chemical reactivity with a high spatiotemporal resolution and chemical versatility is critically important for advancing revolutionary emergent technologies, including nanorobotics, bioprinting, and photopharmacology. Current methods are complex and costly, necessitating novel techniques that are easy to use and compatible with a wide range of chemical functionalities. This study reports the development of a digital light processing (DLP) fluorescence microscope that enables the structuring of visible light (465-625 nm) for high-resolution photochemical patterning and simultaneous fluorescence imaging of patterned samples. A range of visible-light-driven photochemical systems, including thiol-ene photoclick reactions, Wolff rearrangements of diazoketones, and photopolymerizations, are shown to be compatible with this system. Patterning the chemical functionality onto microscopic polymer beads and films is accomplished with photographic quality and resolutions as high as 2.1 μm for Wolff rearrangement chemistry and 5 μm for thiol-ene chemistry. Photoactivation of molecules in living cells is demonstrated with single-cell resolution, and microscale 3D printing is achieved using a polymer resin with a 20 μm xy-resolution and a 100 μm z-resolution. Altogether, this work debuts a powerful and easy-to-use platform that will facilitate next-generation nanorobotic, 3D printing, and metamaterial technologies.

35102718	Bioprinting has seen significant progress in recent years for the fabrication of bionic tissues with high complexity. However, it remains challenging to develop cell-laden bioinks exhibiting superior physiochemical properties and bio-functionality. In this study, a multifunctional nanocomposite bioink is developed based on amine-functionalized copper (Cu)-doped mesoporous bioactive glass nanoparticles (ACuMBGNs) and a hydrogel formulation relying on dynamic covalent chemistry composed of alginate dialdehyde (oxidized alginate) and gelatin, with favorable rheological properties, improved shape fidelity, and structural stability for extrusion-based bioprinting. The reversible dynamic microenvironment in combination with the impact of cell-adhesive ligands introduced by aminated particles enables the rapid spreading (within 3 days) and high survival (>90%) of embedded human osteosarcoma cells and immortalized mouse bone marrow-derived stroma cells. Osteogenic differentiation of primary mouse bone marrow stromal stem cells (BMSCs) and angiogenesis are promoted in the bioprinted alginate dialdehyde-gelatin (ADA-GEL or AG)-ACuMBGN scaffolds without additional growth factors in vitro, which is likely due to ion stimulation from the incorporated nanoparticles and possibly due to cell mechanosensing in the dynamic matrix. In conclusion, it is envisioned that these nanocomposite bioinks can serve as promising platforms for bioprinting complex 3D matrix environments providing superior physiochemical and biological performance for bone tissue engineering.	3D Bioprinting of Multifunctional Dynamic Nanocomposite Bioinks Incorporating Cu-Doped Mesoporous Bioactive Glass Nanoparticles for Bone Tissue Engineering.	2022	Mar	Zhu Hui;Monavari Mahshid;Zheng Kai;Distler Thomas;Ouyang Liliang;Heid Susanne;Jin Zhaorui;He Jiankang;Li Dichen;Boccaccini Aldo R	alginate;bioprinting;dynamic crosslinks;gelatin;hydrogels;mesoporous bioactive glass;nanocomposites	Animals;Bioprinting;Hydrogels;Mice;Nanocomposites;Nanoparticles;Osteogenesis;Printing, Three-Dimensional;Tissue Engineering;Tissue Scaffolds	Small (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)	"State Key Laboratory for Manufacturing Systems Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, 710054, P.

35094846	3D bioprinting has long been subjected to trade-offs between physicochemical and biological outcomes. The resulting material properties of the initial bioinks and final printing products usually lie within a moderate range, which limits the application of bioprinting and its products. Recent progress in bioinks and bioprinting techniques has significantly expanded the window of material properties. In this review, I define two bioprinting windows to clarify the trade-offs between physical chemistry and biology and provide a comprehensive overview of recent advances that have pushed the rheological boundaries of bioinks and mechanical boundaries of bioprints, focusing on unusual material properties. I illustrate this with recent examples, consolidate the existing strategies into well-defined categories, highlight the prominent trends, and provide perspectives on additional boundaries.

35065000	4D bioprinting is promising to build cell-laden constructs (bioconstructs) with complex geometries and functions for tissue/organ regeneration applications. The development of hydrogel-based 4D bioinks, especially those allowing living cell printing, with easy preparation, defined composition, and controlled physical properties is critically important for 4D bioprinting. Here, a single-component jammed micro-flake hydrogel (MFH) system with heterogeneous size distribution, which differs from the conventional granular microgel, has been developed as a new cell-laden bioink for 4D bioprinting. This jammed cytocompatible MFH features scalable production and straightforward composition with shear-thinning, shear-yielding, and rapid self-healing properties. As such, it can be smoothly printed into stable 3D bioconstructs, which can be further cross-linked to form a gradient in cross-linking density when a photoinitiator and a UV absorber are incorporated. After being subject to shape morphing, a variety of complex bioconstructs with well-defined configurations and high cell viability are obtained. Based on this system, 4D cartilage-like tissue formation is demonstrated as a proof-of-concept. The establishment of this versatile new 4D bioink system may open up a number of applications in tissue engineering.

Nowadays, highly efficient bone defect repair remains challenging in clinics. Combining programmable biomaterials, living cells, and bioactive factors, 4D bioprinting provides greater potential for constructing dynamic, personalized, and precise bone tissue engineering scaffolds by complex structure formation and functional maturation. Therefore, 4D bioprinting has been regarded as the next generation of bone repair technology. This review focuses on 4D printing and its advantages in orthopedics. The applications of different smart biomaterials and 4D printing strategies are briefly introduced. Furthermore, one summarizes the recent advancements of 4D printing in bone tissue engineering, uncovering the addressed and unaddressed medical requirements.

35053272	A combination of 3D printing techniques and synthetic biology, 3D bioprinting is a promising field. It is expected that 3D bioprinting technologies will have applications across an array of fields, spanning biotechnology, medical surgery and the pharmaceutical industry. Nonetheless, the progress of these technologies could be hindered, unless there is adequate and effective protection for related applications. In this article, the authors examine the patent eligibility of 3D bioprinting technologies. This issue raises concern given that existing patent systems are generally averse to nature-derived inventions and many of them exclude products of nature or discoveries from patentability. This qualitative study analyses the current patent systems in key jurisdictions, particularly, the U.S. and the EU, and their applicability, as well as effectiveness, in the context of 3D bioprinting. The study argues that the main reason for the apathy of existing patent systems towards bio-inventions is that they were designed to deal with mechanical inventions. It suggests an innovation framework that encompasses both mechanical and biological inventions to cater adequately to emerging technologies.

35037731	Micropores are essential for tissue engineering to ensure adequate mass transportation for embedded cells. Despite the considerable progress made by advanced 3D bioprinting technologies, it remains challenging to engineer micropores of 100 µm or smaller in cell-laden constructs. Here, a microgel-templated porogel (MTP) bioink platform is reported to introduce controlled microporosity in 3D bioprinted hydrogels in the presence of living cells. Templated gelatin microgels are fabricated with varied sizes (≈10, ≈45, and ≈100 µm) and mixed with photo-crosslinkable formulations to make composite MTP bioinks. The addition of microgels significantly enhances the shear-thinning and self-healing viscoelastic properties and thus the printability of bioinks with cell densities up to 1 × 108 mL-1 in matrix. Consistent printability is achieved for a series of MTP bioinks based on different component ratios and matrix materials. After photo-crosslinking the matrix phase, the templated microgels dissociated and diffused under physiological conditions, resulting in corresponding micropores in situ. When embedding osteoblast-like cells in the matrix phase, the MTP bioinks support higher metabolic activity and more uniform mineral formation than bulk gel controls. The approach provides a facile strategy to engineer precise micropores in 3D printed structures to compensate for the limited resolution of current bioprinting approaches.

34996017	It is of great significance to reveal the molecular distribution images in biological tissues, which has led to the bloom of mass spectrometry imaging. Unfortunately, its application is encountering the resistance of high technical barriers and equipment cost, as well as the inability to image substances that cannot be desorbed or ionized, or cannot be separated by their mass-to-charge ratios. Herein presented is a complementary and cost-effective method called capillary array electrophoresis (CAE) imaging. To have the information of molecules and their spatial location, a gridding cutter was fabricated to orderly dissect a tissue section into a leakproof array of micro wells enclosed by the grid-blade arrays. After in situ extraction and fluorophore-labeling of analytes, the samples in the wells were directly subjected to CAE-LIF (laser-induced fluorescence), and the molecular distribution images were depicted with the separated peaks. The practicability was demonstrated by CAE imaging of rat brain tissue sections with amino acid neurotransmitters (e.g., glutamine, 4-aminobutyric acid, alanine, glutamic acid and aspartic acid) as targets. The resultant images showed the global differences of molecular distributions, with a spatial resolution of 1000 μm that was presently determined by the well width but ultimately by the bore size of capillary (down to 10-50 μm). CAE imaging can hence be promising for its low cost, low technical barriers and abundant mechanisms to separate the charged and non-charged, chiral and non-chiral substances.

34952773	Anastomosis of the microvessels requires high-level skills and extensive basic training. This study was performed to introduce and evaluate an inexpensive laboratory device as a training aid. Micro-tubes of 0.8 mm inner diameter and 0.5/0.8 mm wall thickness mimicking human vein/artery were printed from a silicon-containing hydrogel using three-dimensional printing technology. The hydrogel components are optimized to render the printed tubes biomechanical features resembling the blood vessels of a living organism. These artificial vessels were connected to a pump for fluid flow, simulating the blood circulation. Forty medical interns were assigned to two equal groups. The 20 interns in group A practiced anastomosis using the training aid for a total of 10 hours over 5 days. The 20 interns in group B practiced anastomosis using the traditional gum pieces and silicone tubes. Then, all interns performed anastomosis on rat carotid arteries, and their performance was scored by a team of five experienced maxillofacial surgeons. The average success score and time required for anastomosis were compared between the two groups. The mean success score of group A was significantly higher than that of group B (0.83 ± 0.12 vs 0.64 ± 0.10, P < 0.001). The mean anastomosis time of group A was significantly shorter than that of group B (10.2 ± 1.1 vs 17.2 ± 1.4 minutes, P < 0.001). This training device for vessel microanastomosis is an inexpensive, practical, and effective tool for use in laboratories and also reduces the use of animals.

34875360	3D bioprinting has been developed as an effective and powerful technique for the fabrication of living tissue constructs in a well-controlled manner. However, most existing 3D bioprinting strategies face substantial challenges in replicating delicate and intricate tissue-specific structural organizations using mechanically weak biomaterials such as hydrogels. Embedded bioprinting is an emerging bioprinting strategy that can directly fabricate complex structures derived from soft biomaterials within a supporting matrix, which shows great promise in printing large vascularized tissues and organs. Here, we provide a state-of-the-art review on the development of embedded bioprinting including extrusion-based and light-based processes to manufacture complex tissue constructs with biomimetic architectures. The working principles, bioinks, and supporting matrices of embedded printing processes are introduced. The effect of key processing parameters on the printing resolution, shape fidelity, and biological functions of the printed tissue constructs are discussed. Recent innovations in the processes and applications of embedded bioprinting are highlighted, such as light-based volumetric bioprinting and printing of functional vascularized organ constructs. Challenges and future perspectives with regard to translating embedded bioprinting into an effective strategy for the fabrication of functional biological constructs with biomimetic structural organizations are finally discussed. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: It is still challenging to replicate delicate and intricate tissue-specific structural organizations using mechanically-weak hydrogels for the fabrication of functional living tissue constructs. Embedded bioprinting is an emerging 3D printing strategy that enables to produce complex tissue structures directly inside a reservoir filled with supporting matrix, which largely widens the choice of bioprinting inks to ECM-like hydrogels. Here we aim to provide a comprehensive review on various embedded bioprinting techniques mainly including extrusion-based and light-based processes. Various bioinks, supporting matrices, key processing parameters as well as their effects on the structures and biological functions of resultant living tissue constructs are discussed. We expect that it can provide an important reference and generate new insights for the bioprinting of large vascularized tissues and organs with biological functions.

34864451	The field of cardiac tissue engineering has advanced over the past decades; however, most research progress has been limited to engineered cardiac tissues (ECTs) at the microscale with minimal geometrical complexities such as 3D strips and patches. Although microscale ECTs are advantageous for drug screening applications because of their high-throughput and standardization characteristics, they have limited translational applications in heart repair and the in vitro modeling of cardiac function and diseases. Recently, researchers have made various attempts to construct engineered cardiac pumps (ECPs) such as chambered ventricles, recapitulating the geometrical complexity of the native heart. The transition from microscale ECTs to ECPs at a translatable scale would greatly accelerate their translational applications; however, researchers are confronted with several major hurdles, including geometrical reconstruction, vascularization, and functional maturation. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to review the recent advances on bioengineering approaches for fabrication of functional engineered cardiac pumps. We first review the bioengineering approaches to fabricate ECPs, and then emphasize the unmatched potential of 3D bioprinting techniques. We highlight key advances in bioprinting strategies with high cell density as researchers have begun to realize the critical role that the cell density of non-proliferative cardiomyocytes plays in the cell-cell interaction and functional contracting performance. We summarize the current approaches to engineering vasculatures both at micro- and meso-scales, crucial for the survival of thick cardiac tissues and ECPs. We showcase a variety of strategies developed to enable the functional maturation of cardiac tissues, mimicking the in vivo environment during cardiac development. By highlighting state-of-the-art research, this review offers personal perspectives on future opportunities and trends that may bring us closer to the promise of functional ECPs.

34854551	The field of living materials seeks to harness living cells as microfactories that can construct a material itself or enhance the performance of material in some manner. While recent advances in 3D printing allow microbe manipulation to create bespoke living materials, the effective coupling of these living components in reinforced bioink designs remains a major challenge due to the difficulty in building a robust and cell-friendly microenvironment. Here, a type of dual-network bioink is reported for the 3D printing of living materials with enhanced biocatalysis capabilities, where bioinks are readily printable and provide a biocompatible environment along with desirable mechanical performance. It is demonstrated that integrating microbes into these bioinks enables the direct printing of catalytically living materials with high cell viability and maintains metabolic activity, which those living materials can be preserved and reused. Further, a bacteria-algae coculture system is fabricated for the bioremediation of chemicals, giving rise to its potential field applications.	3D Printed Biocatalytic Living Materials with Dual-Network Reinforced Bioinks.	2022	Feb	He Fukun;Ou Yangteng;Liu Ji;Huang Qiu;Tang Bao;Xin Fengxue;Zhang Jing;Jiang Min;Chen Su;Yu Ziyi	3D printing;bioinks;dual-network;living materials	Biocatalysis;Bioprinting;Printing, Three-Dimensional;Tissue Engineering;Tissue Scaffolds	Small (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)	State Key Laboratory of Materials-Oriented Chemical Engineering, College of Chemical Engineering, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Fine Chemicals and Functional Polymer Materials, Nanjing Tech University, Nanjing, 211816, P.

34806790	Room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) has been extensively researched in heavy-metal containing complexes and purely organic systems. Despite the rapid blossom of RTP materials, it is still a tremendous challenge to develop highly efficient blue RTP materials with long-lived lifetimes. Taking the metal-organic framework (MOF) as a model, herein, a feasible strategy of ligand functionalization is proposed, including two essential elements, to develop blue phosphorescence materials with high efficiency and long-lived lifetimes simultaneously under ambient conditions. One is isolation of the chromophores with assistance of another predefined co-ligands, the other is restriction of the chromophores' motions through coordination and host-guest interactions. Remarkably, it renders the MOFs with highly efficient blue phosphorescence up to 80.6% and a lifetime of 169.7 ms under ambient conditions. Moreover, a demo of the crown is fabricated with MOFs ink by 3D printing technique. The potential applications for anti-counterfeiting and fingerprint visualization have been also demonstrated. This finding not only outlines a universal principle to design and synthesize highly efficient RTP materials, but also endows traditional MOFs with fresh vitality for potential applications.

34672027	The encapsulation of cells within gel-phase materials to form bioinks offers distinct advantages for next-generation 3D bioprinting. 3D bioprinting has emerged as a promising tool for patterning cells, but the technology remains limited in its ability to produce biofunctional, tissue-like constructs due to a dearth of materials suitable for bioinks. While early demonstrations commonly used viscous polymers optimized for printability, these materials often lacked cell compatibility and biological functionality. In response, advanced materials that exist in the gel phase during the entire printing process are being developed, since hydrogels are uniquely positioned to both protect cells during extrusion and provide biological signals to embedded cells as the construct matures during culture. Here, an overview of the design considerations for gel-phase materials as bioinks is presented, with a focus on their mechanical, biochemical, and dynamic gel properties. Current challenges and opportunities that arise due to the fact that bioprinted constructs are active, living hydrogels composed of both acellular and cellular components are also evaluated. Engineering hydrogels with consideration of cells as an intrinsic component of the printed bioink will enable control over the evolution of the living construct after printing to achieve greater biofunctionality.	3D Bioprinting of Cell-Laden Hydrogels for Improved Biological Functionality.	2022	Jan	Hull Sarah M;Brunel Lucia G;Heilshorn Sarah C	biofabrication;bioink;bioprinting;hydrogel;regenerative medicine;tissue engineering	Bioprinting;Hydrogels;Polymers;Printing, Three-Dimensional;Tissue Engineering	Advanced materials (Deerfield Beach, Fla.)

34664115	Immobilizing microorganisms inside 3D printed semi-permeable substrates can be desirable for biotechnological processes since it simplifies product separation and purification, reducing costs, and processing time. To this end, we developed a strategy for synthesizing a feedstock suitable for 3D bioprinting of mechanically rigid and insoluble materials with embedded living bacteria. The processing route is based on a highly particle-filled alumina/chitosan nanocomposite gel which is reinforced by (a) electrostatic interactions with alginate and (b) covalent binding between the chitosan molecules with the mild gelation agent genipin. To analyze network formation and material properties, we characterized the rheological properties and printability of the feedstock gel. Stability measurements showed that the genipin-crosslinked chitosan/alginate/alumina gels did not dissolve in PBS, NaOH, or HCl after 60 days of incubation. Alginate-containing gels also showed less swelling in water than gels without alginate. Furthermore, E. coli bacteria were embedded in the nanocomposites and we analyzed the influence of the individual bioink components as well as of the printing process on bacterial viability. Here, the addition of alginate was necessary to maintain the effective viability of the embedded bacteria, while samples without alginate showed no bacterial viability. The experimental results demonstrate the potential of this approach for producing macroscopic bioactive materials with complex 3D geometries as a platform for novel applications in bioprocessing.

There are two types of substitutes: acellular skin substitutes, which offer a low response to the body, and cellular skin substitutes (CSSs), which incorporate living cells and appear as a great alternative in the treatment of skin injuries due to their greater interaction and integration with the rest of the body. For the development of a CSS, it is necessary to select the most suitable biomaterials, cell components, and methodology of biofabrication for the wound to be treated. Moreover, these CSSs are immature substitutes that must undergo a maturing process in specific bioreactors, guaranteeing their functionality. The bioreactor simulates the natural state of maturation of the skin by controlling parameters such as temperature, pressure, or humidity, allowing a homogeneous maturation of the CSSs in an aseptic environment. The use of bioreactors not only contributes to the maturation of the CSSs but also offers a new way of obtaining large sections of skin substitutes or natural skin from small portions acquired from the patient, donor, or substitute. Based on the innovation of this technology and the need to develop efficient CSSs, this work offers an update on bioreactor technology in the field of skin regeneration. Impact Statement The manufacture of functional cellular skin substitutes (CSSs) is one of the current goals in the field of tissue engineering to improve the treatment of chronic skin injuries, thus favoring skin repair and regeneration. The main advances in the development of innovative and effective CSSs are largely focused on the selection of more adequate cellular components, biomaterials, and biofabrication techniques to be used in their biofabrication. However, the maturation of CSSs should be an essential step in obtaining a functional substitute capable of replacing the native skin. The sequential procedure from the design of the CSS to its maturation process will be reviewed. In the context of the manufacturing of novel CSSs, different technologies to biofabricate functional structures and how their maturation can be carried out by specific devices are addressed, as well as key challenges facing the design and development of CSSs.

34647258	The desire to understand gravitational effects on living things requires the removal of the very factor that determines life on Earth. Unfortunately, the required free-fall conditions that provide such conditions are limited to a few seconds unless earth-orbiting platforms are available. Therefore, attempts have been made to create conditions that simulate reduced gravity or gravity-free conditions ever since the gravity effects have been studied. Such conditions depend mostly on rotating devices (aka clinostats) that alter the gravity vector faster than the biological response time or create conditions that compensate sedimentation by fluid dynamics. Although several sophisticated, commercial instruments are available, they are unaffordable to most individual investigators. This article describes important considerations for the design and construction of low cost but versatile instruments that are sturdy, fully programmable, and affordable. The chapter focuses on detailed construction, programming of microcontrollers, versatility, and reliability of the instrument.

34544668	In recent years, the development of digital imaging technology has had a significant influence in liver surgery. The ability to obtain a 3-dimensional (3D) visualization of the liver anatomy has provided surgery with virtual reality of simulation 3D computer models, 3D printing models and more recently holograms and augmented reality (when virtual reality knowledge is superimposed onto reality). In addition, the utilization of real-time fluorescent imaging techniques based on indocyanine green (ICG) uptake allows clinicians to precisely delineate the liver anatomy and/or tumors within the parenchyma, applying the knowledge obtained preoperatively through digital imaging. The combination of both has transformed the abstract thinking until now based on 2D imaging into a 3D preoperative conception (virtual reality), enhanced with real-time visualization of the fluorescent liver structures, effectively facilitating intraoperative navigated liver surgery (augmented reality).

34537505	Combining tissue engineering and three-dimensional (3D) printing may allow for the introduction of a living functional tracheal replacement graft. However, defining the biomechanical properties of the native trachea is a key prerequisite to clinical translation.

34534709	Tissue engineering approaches for bone repair have rapidly evolved due to the development of novel biofabrication technologies, providing an opportunity to fabricate anatomically-accurate living implants with precise placement of specific cell types. However, limited availability of biomaterial inks, that can be 3D-printed with high resolution, while providing high structural support and the potential to direct cell differentiation and maturation towards the osteogenic phenotype, remains an ongoing challenge. Aiming towards a multifunctional biomaterial ink with high physical stability and biological functionality, this work describes the development of a nanocomposite biomaterial ink (Mg-PCL) comprising of magnesium hydroxide nanoparticles (Mg) and polycaprolactone (PCL) thermoplastic for 3D printing of strong and bioactive bone regenerative scaffolds. We characterised the Mg nanoparticle system and systematically investigated the cytotoxic and osteogenic effects of Mg supplementation to human mesenchymal stromal cells (hMSCs) 2D-cultures. Next, we prepared Mg-PCL biomaterial ink using a solvent casting method, and studied the effect of Mg over mechanical properties, printability and scaffold degradation. Furthermore, we delivered MSCs within Mg-PCL scaffolds using a gelatin-methacryloyl (GelMA) matrix, and evaluated the effect of Mg over cell viability and osteogenic differentiation. Nanocomposite Mg-PCL could be printed with high fidelity at 20 wt% of Mg content, and generated a mechanical reinforcement between 30%-400% depending on the construct internal geometry. We show that Mg-PCL degrades faster than standard PCL in an accelerated-degradation assay, which has positive implications towards in vivo implant degradation and bone regeneration. Mg-PCL did not affect MSCs viability, but enhanced osteogenic differentiation and bone-specific matrix deposition, as demonstrated by higher ALP/DNA levels and Alizarin Red calcium staining. Finally, we present proof of concept of Mg-PCL being utilised in combination with a bone-specific bioink (Sr-GelMA) in a coordinated-extrusion bioprinting strategy for fabrication of hybrid constructs with high stability and synergistic biological functionality. Mg-PCL further enhanced the osteogenic differentiation of encapsulated MSCs and supported bone ECM deposition within the bioink component of the hybrid construct, evidenced by mineralised nodule formation, osteocalcin (OCN) and collagen type-I (Col I) expression within the bioink filaments. This study demonstrated that magnesium-based nanocomposite bioink material optimised for extrusion-based 3D printing of bone regenerative scaffolds provide enhanced mechanical stability and bone-related bioactivity with promising potential for skeletal tissue regeneration.

34240472	Plastics are now indispensable in daily lives. However, the pollution from plastics is also increasingly becoming a serious environmental issue. Recent years have seen more sustainable approaches and technologies, commonly known as upcycling, to transform plastics into value-added materials and chemical feedstocks. In this review, the latest research on upcycling is presented, with a greater focus on the use of renewable energy as well as the more selective methods to repurpose synthetic polymers. First, thermal upcycling approaches are briefly introduced, including the redeployment of plastics for construction uses, 3D printing precursors, and lightweight materials. Then, some of the latest novel strategies to deconstruct condensation polymers to monomers for repolymerization or introduce vulnerable linkers to make the plastics more degradable are discussed. Subsequently, the review will explore the breakthroughs in plastics upcycling by heterogeneous and homogeneous photocatalysis, as well as electrocatalysis, which transform plastics into more versatile fine chemicals and materials while simultaneously mitigating global climate change. In addition, some of the biotechnological advances in the discovery and engineering of microbes that can decompose plastics are also presented. Finally, the current challenges and outlook for future plastics upcycling are discussed to stimulate global cooperation in this field.

34230892	Organ or cell transplantation is medically evaluated for end-stage failure saving or extending the lives of thousands of patients who are suffering from organ failure disorders. The unavailability of adequate organs for transplantation to meet the existing demand is a major challenge in the medical field. This led to day-day-increase in the number of patients on transplant waiting lists as well as in the number of patients dying while on the queue. Recently, technological advancements in the field of biogenerative engineering have the potential to regenerate tissues and, in some cases, create new tissues and organs. In this context, major advances and innovations are being made in the fields of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine which have a huge impact on the scientific community is three-dimensional bioprinting (3D bioprinting) of tissues and organs. Besides this, the decellularization of organs and using this as a scaffold for generating new organs through the recellularization process shows promising results. This review discussed about current approaches for tissue and organ engineering including methods of scaffold designing, recent advances in 3D bioprinting, organs regenerated successfully using 3D printing, and extended application of 3D bioprinting technique in the field of medicine.

33511846	Pectin hydrogel is a soft hydrocolloid with multifaceted utilities in the food sector. Substantial knowledge acquired on the gelation mechanisms and structure-function relationship of pectin has led to interesting functions of pectin hydrogel. Food applications of pectin hydrogels can be categorized under four headings: food ingredients/additives, food packaging, bioactive delivery and health management. The cross-linked and tangly three-dimensional structure of pectin gel renders it an ideal choice of wall material for the encapsulation of biomolecules and living cells; as a fat replacer and texturizer. Likewise, pectin hydrogel is an effective satiety inducer due to its ability to swell under the simulated gastric and intestinal conditions without losing its gel structure. Coating or composites of pectin hydrogel with proteins and other polysaccharides augment its functionality as an encapsulant, satiety-inducer and food packaging material. Low-methoxyl pectin gel is an appropriate food ink for 3D printing applications due to its viscoelastic properties, adaptable microstructure and texture properties. This review aims at explaining all the applications of pectin hydrogels, as mentioned above. A comprehensive discussion is presented on the approaches by which pectin hydrogel can be transformed as a resourceful material by controlling its dimensions, state, and rheology. The final sections of this article emphasize the recent research trends in this discipline, such as the development of smart hydrogels, injectable gels, aerogels, xerogels and oleogels from pectin.

32628556	Our aim is to define the design and procedure of a 3D printed assistive device and to produce a prototype assistive device for an individual with quadriplegia in order to enable him/her to independently conduct daily living activities. For the design and production of the 3D assistive device, we followed six steps. In the first step-determination of problematic activity/client-centered approach-writing activity was determined as the most problematic activity as a result of the interview with a paraplegic patient. Then, 2D drawings of the assistive device were created as the second step. For the third step the 3D scan of the individual's right hand was obtained. 3D scan of the right hand was transferred to CATIA program and the 3D printer is used in the manufacturing process for the fourth step. In the fifth step, we produced a low-cost novel writing assistive device. The writing device was introduced to the disabled individual and training was given regarding its practical use in the final step teaching the use of the device. As 3D printing technology progresses and becomes more reliable, we believe that the production of assistive devices will become much easier and their use will become more prevalent.

38187760	Natural ecosystems offer efficient pathways for carbon sequestration, serving as a resilient approach to remove CO2 from the atmosphere with minimal environmental impact. However, the control of living systems outside of their native environments is often challenging. Here, we engineered a photosynthetic living material for dual CO2 sequestration by immobilizing photosynthetic microorganisms within a printable polymeric network. The carbon concentrating mechanism of the cyanobacteria enabled accumulation of CO2 within the cell, resulting in biomass production. Additionally, the metabolic production of OH- ions in the surrounding medium created an environment for the formation of insoluble carbonates via microbially-induced calcium carbonate precipitation (MICP). Digital design and fabrication of the living material ensured sufficient access to light and nutrient transport of the encapsulated cyanobacteria, which were essential for long-term viability (more than one year) as well as efficient photosynthesis and carbon sequestration. The photosynthetic living materials sequestered approximately 2.5 mg of CO2 per gram of hydrogel material over 30 days via dual carbon sequestration, with 2.2 ± 0.9 mg stored as insoluble carbonates. Over an extended incubation period of 400 days, the living materials sequestered 26 ± 7 mg of CO2 per gram of hydrogel material in the form of stable minerals. These findings highlight the potential of photosynthetic living materials for scalable carbon sequestration, carbon-neutral infrastructure, and green building materials. The simplicity of maintenance, coupled with its scalability nature, suggests broad applications of photosynthetic living materials as a complementary strategy to mitigate CO2 emissions.

38153404	Great effort has been made to encapsulate or coat living mammalian cells for a variety of applications ranging from diabetes treatment to three-dimensional printing. However, no study has reported the synthesis of a biomimetic bacterial capsule to display high-affinity aptamers on the cell surface for enhanced cell recognition. Therefore, we synthesized an ultrathin alginate-polylysine coating to display aptamers on the surface of living cells with natural killer (NK) cells as a model. The results show that this coating-mediated aptamer display is more stable than direct cholesterol insertion into the lipid bilayer. The half-life of the aptamer on the cell surface can be increased from less than 1.5 to over 20 h. NK cells coated with the biomimetic bacterial capsule exhibit a high efficiency in recognizing and killing target cells. Therefore, this work has demonstrated a promising cell coating method for the display of aptamers for enhanced cell recognition.

38145962	3D bioprinting has enabled the fabrication of tissue-mimetic constructs with freeform designs that include living cells. In the development of new bioprinting techniques, the controlled use of diffusion has become an emerging strategy to tailor the properties and geometry of printed constructs. Specifically, the diffusion of molecules with specialized functions, including crosslinkers, catalysts, growth factors, or viscosity-modulating agents, across the interface of printed constructs will directly affect material properties such as microstructure, stiffness, and biochemistry, all of which can impact cell phenotype. For example, diffusion-induced gelation is employed to generate constructs with multiple materials, dynamic mechanical properties, and perfusable geometries. In general, these diffusion-based bioprinting strategies can be categorized into those based on inward diffusion (i.e., into the printed ink from the surrounding air, solution, or support bath), outward diffusion (i.e., from the printed ink into the surroundings), or diffusion within the printed construct (i.e., from one zone to another). This review provides an overview of recent advances in diffusion-based bioprinting strategies, discusses emerging methods to characterize and predict diffusion in bioprinting, and highlights promising next steps in applying diffusion-based strategies to overcome current limitations in biofabrication.

38145905	Space three dimension (3D） bioprinting provides a precise and bionic tumor model for evaluating the compound effect of the space environment on tumors, thereby providing insight into the progress of the disease and potential treatments. However, space 3D bioprinting faces several challenges, including prelaunch uncertainty, possible liquid leakage, long-term culture in space, automatic equipment control, data acquisition, and transmission. Here, a novel satellite-based 3D bioprinting device with high structural strength, small volume, and low weight (<6 kg) is developed. A microgel-based biphasic thermosensitive bioink and suspension medium that supports the on-orbit printing and in situ culture of complex tumor models is developed. An intelligent control algorithm that enables the automatic control of 3D printing, autofocusing, fluorescence imaging, and data transfer back to the ground is developed. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first time that on-orbit printing of tumor models is achieved in space with stable morphology and moderate viability via a satellite. It is found that 3D tumor models are more sensitive to antitumor drugs in space than on Earth. This study opens up a new avenue for 3D bioprinting in space and offers new possibilities for future research in space life science and medicine.

38144518	Osteosarcoma (OS) is the third most common malignancy in adolescence. Currently, the treatments of OS confront great obstacles of tumor recurrence and critical bone defects after surgery, severely affecting the survival rates and living qualities of patients. Hence, it is urged to develop distinct biomaterials with both efficient tumor therapeutic and osteogenic functions. Although photothermal therapy (PTT) has aroused expanding interest, characterizing negligible invasiveness and high spatiotemporal adjustment, few studies discussed its drawbacks, such as thermal injury to adjacent normal tissue and exceeded laser power density, implying that focusing on sensitizing OS to PTT instead of simply elevating the laser power density may be a fresh way to enhance the PTT efficacy and attenuate the side/adverse effects. Herein, we successfully constructed 3D-printing silicene bioactive glass scaffolds with preferable PTT efficacy at the second near-infrared (NIR-II) biowindow and outstanding osteogenic biofunctions owing to the release of bioactive elements during degradation. Impressively, a histone demethylase inhibitor, IOX1, was introduced before PTT to sensitize OS to thermal therapy and minimize the side/adverse effects. This work offered a distinctive paradigm for optimizing the PTT efficacy of osteogenic scaffolds against OS with epigenetic modulation agents.

38144142	The scope of three-dimensional printing is expanding rapidly, with innovative approaches resulting in the evolution of state-of-the-art 3D bioprinting (3DbioP) techniques for solving issues in bioengineering and biopharmaceutical research. The methods and tools in 3DbioP emphasize the extrusion process, bioink formulation, and stability of the bioprinted scaffold. Thus, 3DbioP technology augments 3DP in the biological world by providing technical support to regenerative therapy, drug delivery, bioengineering of prosthetics, and drug kinetics research. Besides the above, drug delivery and dosage control have been achieved using 3D bioprinted microcarriers and capsules. Developing a stable, biocompatible, and versatile bioink is a primary requisite in biofabrication. The 3DbioP research is breaking the technical barriers at a breakneck speed. Numerous techniques and biomaterial advancements have helped to overcome current 3DbioP issues related to printability, stability, and bioink formulation. Therefore, this Review aims to provide an insight into the technical challenges of bioprinting, novel biomaterials for bioink formulation, and recently developed 3D bioprinting methods driving future applications in biofabrication research.

38143295	A cross-comparison of three stop-flow configurations-such as low-pressure (LSF), high-pressure open-circuit (OC-HSF), and high-pressure short-circuit (SC-HSF) stop-flow-is presented to rapidly bring a high velocity flow O(m s-1 ) within a microchannel to a standstill O(µm s-1 ). The performance of three stop-flow configurations is assessed by measuring residual flow velocities within microchannels having three orders of magnitude different flow resistances. The LSF configuration outperforms the OC-HSF and SC-HSF configurations within a high flow resistance microchannel and results in a residual velocity of <10 µm s-1 . The OC-HSF configuration results in a residual velocity of <150 µm s-1 within a low flow resistance microchannel. The SC-HSF configuration results in a residual velocity of <200 µm s-1 across the three orders-of-magnitude different flow resistance microchannels, and <100 µm s-1 for the low flow resistance channel. It is hypothesized that residual velocity results from compliance in fluidic circuits, which is further investigated by varying the elasticity of microchannel walls and connecting tubing. A numerical model is developed to estimate the expanded volumes of the compliant microchannel and connecting tubings under a pressure gradient and to calculate the distance traveled by the sample fluid. A comparison of the numerically and experimentally obtained traveling distances confirms the hypothesis that the residual velocities are an outcome of the compliance in the fluidic circuit.

38143276	Stable regulation of protein fate is a prerequisite for successful bone tissue repair. As a ubiquitin-specific protease (USP), USP26 can stabilize the protein fate of β-catenin to promote the osteogenic activity of mesenchymal cells (BMSCs) and significantly increased bone regeneration in bone defects in aged mice. However, direct transfection of Usp26 in vivo is inefficient. Therefore, improving the efficient expression of USP26 in target cells is the key to promoting bone tissue repair. Herein, 3D printing combined with microfluidic technology is applied to construct a functional microunit (protein fate regulating functional microunit, denoted as PFFM), which includes GelMA microspheres loaded with BMSCs overexpressing Usp26 and seeded into PCL 3D printing scaffolds. The PFFM provides a microenvironment for BMSCs, significantly promotes adhesion, and ensures cell activity and Usp26 supplementation that stabilizes β-catenin protein significantly facilitates BMSCs to express osteogenic phenotypes. In vivo experiments have shown that PFFM effectively accelerates intervertebral bone fusion. Therefore, PFFM can provide new ideas and alternatives for using USP26 for intervertebral fusion and other hard-to-repair bone defect diseases and is expected to provide clinical translational potential in future treatments.

38112236	Anisotropic materials formed by living organisms possess remarkable mechanical properties due to their intricate microstructure and directional freedom. In contrast, human-made materials face challenges in achieving similar levels of directionality due to material and manufacturability constraints. To overcome these limitations, an approach using 3D printing of self-assembling thermotropic liquid crystal polymers (LCPs) is presented. Their high stiffness and strength is granted by nematic domains aligning during the extrusion process. Here, a remarkably wide range of Young's modulus from 3 to 40 GPa is obtained by utilizing directionality of the nematic flow the printing process.   By determining a relationship between stiffness, nozzle diameter, and line width, a design space where shaping and mechanical performance can be combined is identified. The ability to print LCPs with on-the-fly width changes to accommodate arbitrary spatially varying directions is demonstrated. This unlocks the possibility to manufacture exquisite patterns inspired by fluid dynamics with steep curvature variations. Utilizing the synergy between this path-planning method and LCPs, functional objects with stiffness and curvature gradients can be 3D-printed, offering potential applications in lightweight sustainable structures embedding crack-mitigation strategies. This method also opens avenues for studying and replicating intricate patterns observed in nature, such as wood or turbulent flow using 3D printing.	3D Printing of Flow-Inspired Anisotropic Patterns with Liquid Crystalline Polymers.	2024	Mar	Houriet Caroline;Damodaran Vinay;Mascolo Chiara;Gantenbein Silvan;Peeters Daniël;Masania Kunal	additive manufacturing;bio-inspired materials;gradients;liquid crystal polymers;mechanical anisotropy;toughening		Advanced materials (Deerfield Beach, Fla.)

38108930	Helical hierarchy found in biomolecules like cellulose, chitin, and collagen underpins the remarkable mechanical strength and vibrant colors observed in living organisms. This study advances the integration of helical/chiral assembly and 3D printing technology, providing precise spatial control over chiral nano/microstructures of rod-shaped colloidal nanoparticles in intricate geometries. We designed reactive chiral inks based on cellulose nanocrystal (CNC) suspensions and acrylamide monomers, enabling the chiral assembly at nano/microscale, beyond the resolution seen in printed materials. We employed a range of complementary techniques including Orthogonal Superposition rheometry and in situ rheo-optic measurements under steady shear rate conditions. These techniques help us to understand the nature of the nonlinear flow behavior of the chiral inks, and directly probe the flow-induced microstructural dynamics and phase transitions at constant shear rates, as well as their post-flow relaxation. Furthermore, we analyzed the photo-curing process to identify key parameters affecting gelation kinetics and structural integrity of the printed object within the supporting bath. These insights into the interplay between the chiral inks self-assembly dynamics, 3D printing flow kinematics and photo-polymerization kinetics provide a roadmap to direct the out-of-equilibrium arrangement of CNC particles in the 3D printed filaments, ranging from uniform nematic to 3D concentric chiral structures with controlled pitch length, as well as random orientation of chiral domains. Our biomimetic approach can pave the way for the creation of materials with superior mechanical properties or programable photonic responses that arise from 3D nano/microstructure and can be translated into larger scale 3D printed designs.

38071898	Predicting ecological responses to rapid environmental change has become one of the greatest challenges of modern biology. One of the major hurdles in forecasting these responses is accurately quantifying the thermal environments that organisms experience. The distribution of temperatures available within an organism's habitat is typically measured using data loggers called operative temperature models (OTMs) that are designed to mimic certain properties of heat exchange in the focal organism. The gold standard for OTM construction in studies of terrestrial ectotherms has been the use of copper electroforming which creates anatomically accurate models that equilibrate quickly to ambient thermal conditions. However, electroformed models require the use of caustic chemicals, are often brittle, and their production is expensive and time intensive. This has resulted in many researchers resorting to the use of simplified OTMs that can yield substantial measurement errors. 3D printing offers the prospect of robust, easily replicated, morphologically accurate, and cost-effective OTMs that capture the benefits but alleviate the problems associated with electroforming. Here, we validate the use of OTMs that were 3D printed using several materials across eight lizard species of different body sizes and living in habitats ranging from deserts to tropical forests. We show that 3D printed OTMs have low thermal inertia and predict the live animal's equilibration temperature with high accuracy across a wide range of body sizes and microhabitats. Finally, we developed a free online repository and database of 3D scans (https://www.3dotm.org/) to increase the accessibility of this tool to researchers around the world and facilitate ease of production of 3D printed models. 3D printing of OTMs is generalizable to taxa beyond lizards. If widely adopted, this approach promises greater accuracy and reproducibility in studies of terrestrial thermal ecology and should lead to improved forecasts of the biological impacts of climate change.	3D printed models are an accurate, cost-effective, and reproducible tool for quantifying terrestrial thermal environments.	2024	Jan	Alujević Karla;Bakewell Leah;Clifton Ian T;Cox Christian L;Frishkoff Luke O;Gangloff Eric J;Garcia-Costoya Guillermo;Gifford Matthew E;Glenwinkel Madison;Gulati Samir A K;Head Alyssa;Miles Monica;Pettit Ciara;Watson Charles M;Wuthrich Kelly L;Logan Michael L	3D printing;Biophysical model;Climate change;OTM;Open database;Operative temperature model;Thermal physiology;Thermoregulation	Animals;Body Temperature Regulation;Cost-Benefit Analysis;Reproducibility of Results;Body Temperature;Temperature;Ecosystem;Lizards;Printing, Three-Dimensional	Journal of thermal biology	Department of Biology and Program in Ecology, Evolution, and Conservation Biology, University of Nevada, Reno, NV, 89557, USA.

38049232	Copper ion (Cu2+) is not only a transition metal ion but also a significant environmental pollutant. The imbalance of Cu2+ content will threaten the safety of the environment and even life. The portable detection devices based on ratiometric fluorescent probes have garnered increasing attention and acclaim because of their reliable analysis parameters. Therefore, two Cu2+ ratiometric fluorescent probes (RH-1 and RH-2) were developed, which exhibit pronounced fluorescence changes, high sensitivity, excellent selectivity, and large Stokes shift. Both probes are capable of detecting Cu2+ in water and milk samples. It is worth noting that a 3D-printed fluorescence sensing device was constructed using RH-1, and a new 3D-printed copper ion detection kit was developed based on RH-2, enabling on-the-spot estimation of Cu2+ concentration. These devices significantly facilitate Cu2+ detection in daily life. RH-2 has been successfully employed for imaging Cu2+ in living cells and zebrafish. In conclusion, this work provides, for the first time, the 3D-printed ideal tools for detecting Cu2+. It also provides valuable insights for the establishment of on-site portable detection methods for other important substances.	3D-printed colorimetric copper ion detection kit and portable fluorescent sensing device using smartphone based on ratiometric fluorescent probes.	2024	Jan	Liu Mengyuan;Zhu Hanchuang;Fang Yikun;Liu Caiyun;Wang Kun;Zhang Xiaohui;Li Xinke;Ma Lixue;Yu Miaohui;Sheng Wenlong;Zhu Baocun	3D-printed device;Bioimaging;Copper ions;Ratiometric fluorescent probe	Animals;Fluorescent Dyes;Copper;Smartphone;Colorimetry;Zebrafish;Printing, Three-Dimensional;Spectrometry, Fluorescence	Analytica chimica acta	School of Water Conservancy and Environment, University of Jinan, Jinan, 250022, China.;School of Water Conservancy and Environment, University of Jinan, Jinan, 250022, China.;School of Water Conservancy and Environment, University of Jinan, Jinan, 250022, China.;School of Water Conservancy and Environment, University of Jinan, Jinan, 250022, China.

38041693	Three dimensional printing has emerged as a widely acceptable strategy for the fabrication of mammalian cell laden constructs with complex microenvironments for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. More recently 3D printed living materials containing microorganisms have been developed and matured into living biofilms. The potential for engineered 3D biofilms as in vitro models for biomedical applications, such as antimicrobial susceptibility testing, and environmental applications, such as bioleaching, bioremediation, and wastewater purification, is extensive but the need for an in-depth understanding of the structure-function relationship between the complex construct and the microorganism response still exists. This review discusses 3D printing fabrication methods for engineered biofilms with specific structural features. Next, it highlights the importance of bioink compositions and 3D bioarchitecture design. Finally, a brief overview of current and potential applications of 3D printed biofilms in environmental and biomedical fields is discussed.

38038860	Bioprinting is an additive manufacturing technology analogous to 3D printing. Instead of plastic or resin, cell-laden hydrogels are used to produce a construct of the intended biological structure. Over time, cells transform this construct into a functioning tissue or organ. The process of printing followed by tissue maturation is referred to as 4D bioprinting. The fourth dimension is temporal. Failure to provide living cells with sufficient amounts of oxygen at any point along the developmental timeline may jeopardize the bioprinting goals. Even transient hypoxia may alter cells' differentiation and proliferation or trigger apoptosis. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) imaging modality is proposed to permit 4D monitoring of oxygen within bioprinted structures.

38030636	High glucose-induced vascular endothelial injury is a major pathological factor involved in non-healing diabetic wounds. To interrupt this pathological process, we design an all-peptide printable hydrogel platform based on highly efficient and precise one-step click chemistry of thiolated γ-polyglutamic acid, glycidyl methacrylate-conjugated γ-polyglutamic acid, and thiolated arginine-glycine-aspartate sequences. Vascular endothelial growth factor 165-overexpressed human umbilical vein endothelial cells are printed using this platform, hence fabricating a living material with high cell viability and precise cell spatial distribution control. This cell-laden hydrogel platform accelerates the diabetic wound healing of rats based on the unabated vascular endothelial growth factor 165 release, which promotes angiogenesis and alleviates damages on vascular endothelial mitochondria, thereby reducing tissue hypoxia, downregulating inflammation, and facilitating extracellular matrix remodeling. Together, this study offers a promising strategy for fabricating tissue-friendly, high-efficient, and accurate 3D printed all-peptide hydrogel platform for cell delivery and self-renewable growth factor therapy.

37998113	Coronary artery disease is the most prevalent cardiovascular disease, claiming millions of lives annually around the world. The current treatment includes surgically inserting a tubular construct, called a stent, inside arteries to restore blood flow. However, due to lack of patient-specific design, the commercial products cannot be used with different vessel anatomies. In this review, we have summarized the drawbacks in existing commercial metal stents which face problems of restenosis and inflammatory responses, owing to the development of neointimal hyperplasia. Further, we have highlighted the fabrication of stents using biodegradable polymers, which can circumvent most of the existing limitations. In this regard, we elaborated on the utilization of new fabrication methodologies based on additive manufacturing such as three-dimensional printing to design patient-specific stents. Finally, we have discussed the functionalization of these stent surfaces with suitable bioactive molecules which can prove to enhance their properties in preventing thrombosis and better healing of injured blood vessel lining.

37949427	Three-dimensional (3D) printing is a promising approach for the stabilization and delivery of non-living biologics. This versatile tool builds complex structures and customized resolutions, and has significant potential in various industries, especially pharmaceutics and biopharmaceutics. Biologics have become increasingly prevalent in the field of medicine due to their diverse applications and benefits. Stability is the main attribute that must be achieved during the development of biologic formulations. 3D printing could help to stabilize biologics by entrapment, support binding, or crosslinking. Furthermore, gene fragments could be transited into cells during co-printing, when the pores on the membrane are enlarged. This review provides: (i) an introduction to 3D printing technologies and biologics, covering genetic elements, therapeutic proteins, antibodies, and bacteriophages; (ii) an overview of the applications of 3D printing of biologics, including regenerative medicine, gene therapy, and personalized treatments; (iii) information on how 3D printing could help to stabilize and deliver biologics; and (iv) discussion on regulations, challenges, and future directions, including microneedle vaccines, novel 3D printing technologies and artificial-intelligence-facilitated research and product development. Overall, the 3D printing of biologics holds great promise for enhancing human health by providing extended longevity and enhanced quality of life, making it an exciting area in the rapidly evolving field of biomedicine.	3D printing of biologics-what has been accomplished to date?	2024	Jan	Lu Anqi;Williams Robert O;Maniruzzaman Mohammed	3D bioprinting;3D printing biologics;microneedles;protein delivery;vaccine	Humans;Quality of Life;Drug Delivery Systems;Printing, Three-Dimensional;Precision Medicine;Biological Products	Drug discovery today	Division of Molecular Pharmaceutics and Drug Delivery, College of Pharmacy, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX 78712, USA.;Division of Molecular Pharmaceutics and Drug Delivery, College of Pharmacy, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX 78712, USA.;Division of Molecular Pharmaceutics and Drug Delivery, College of Pharmacy, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX 78712, USA; Pharmaceutical Engineering and 3D Printing (PharmE3D) Lab, Department of Pharmaceutics and Drug Delivery, School of Pharmacy, The University of Mississippi, University, MS 38677, USA.

37930736	Hybrid bioprinting uses sequential printing of melt-extruded biodegradable thermoplastic polymer and cell-encapsulated bioink in a predesigned manner using high- and low-temperature print heads for the fabrication of robust three-dimensional (3D) biological constructs. However, the high-temperature print head and melt-extruded polymer cause irreversible thermal damage to the bioprinted cells, and it affects viability and functionality of 3D bioprinted biological constructs. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop innovative approaches to protect the bioprinted cells, coming into contact or at close proximities to the melt-extruded thermoplastic polymer and the high-temperature print head during hybrid bioprinting. Therefore, this study investigated the potential of iterating the structural architecture pattern (SAP) of melt-printed thermoplastic layers and the cell printing pattern (CPP) to protect the cells from temperature-associated damage during hybrid bioprinting. A novel SAP for printing the thermoplastic polymer and an associated CPP for minimizing thermal damage to the 3D bioprinted construct have been developed. The newly developed SAP- and CPP-based hybrid bioprinted biological constructs showed significantly low thermal damage compared to conventionally hybrid bioprinted biological constructs. The results from this study suggest that the newly developed SAP and CPP can be an improved hybrid bioprinting strategy for developing living constructs at the human scale.

37919778	Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) which involves gradual loss of kidney function is characterized by low levels of a glycoprotein called Erythropoietin (EPO) that leads to red blood cell  deficiency and anemia. Recombinant human EPO (rhEPO) injections that are administered intravenously or subcutaneously is the current gold standard for treating CKD. The rhEPO injections have very short half-lives and thus demands frequent administration with a risk of high endogenous EPO levels leading to severe side effects that could prove fatal. To this effect, this work provides a novel approach of using lamellar inorganic solids with a brucite-like structure for controlling the release of protein therapeutics such as rhEPO in injectable hydrogels. The nanoengineered injectable system was formulated by incorporating two-dimensional layered double hydroxide (LDH) clay materials with a high surface area into alginate hydrogels for sustained delivery. The inclusion of LDH in the hydrogel network not only improved the mechanical properties of the hydrogels (5-30 times that of alginate hydrogel) but also exhibited a high binding affinity to proteins without altering their bioactivity and conformation. Furthermore, the nanoengineered injectable hydrogels (INHs) demonstrated quick gelation, injectability, and excellent adhesion properties on human skin. The in vitro release test of EPO from conventional alginate hydrogels (Alg-Gel) showed 86% EPO release within 108 h while INHs showed greater control over the initial burst and released only 24% of EPO in the same incubation time. INH-based ink was successfully used for 3D printing, resulting in scaffolds with good shape fidelity and stability in cell culture media. Controlled release of EPO from INHs facilitated superior angiogenic potential in ovo (chick chorioallantoic membrane) compared to Alg-Gel. When subcutaneously implanted in albino mice, the INHs formed a stable gel in vivo without inducing any adverse effects. The results suggest that the proposed INHs in this study can be utilized as a minimally invasive injectable platform or as 3D printed patches for the delivery of protein therapeutics to facilitate tissue regeneration.

37886418	A three-dimensional (3D) printing is a robotically controlled state-of-the-art technology that is promising for all branches of engineering with a meritorious emphasis to biomedical engineering. The purpose of 3D printing (3DP) is to create exact superstructures without any framework in a brief period with high reproducibility to create intricate and complex patient-tailored structures for organ regeneration, drug delivery, imaging processes, designing personalized dose-specific tablets, developing 3D models of organs to plan surgery and to understand the pathology of disease, manufacturing cost-effective surgical tools, and fabricating implants and organ substitute devices for prolonging the lives of patients, etc. The formulation of bioinks and programmed G codes help to obtain precise 3D structures, which determines the stability and functioning of the 3D-printed structures. Three-dimensional printing for medical applications is ambitious and challenging but made possible with the culmination of research expertise from various fields. Exploring and expanding 3DP for biomedical and clinical applications can be life-saving solutions. The 3D printers are cost-effective and eco-friendly, as they do not release any toxic pollutants or waste materials that pollute the environment. The sampling requirements and processing parameters are amenable, which further eases the production. This review highlights the role of 3D printers in the health care sector, focusing on their roles in tablet development, imaging techniques, disease model development, and tissue regeneration.

37886417	Single-step 3D printing, which can manufacture complicated designs without assembly, has the potential to completely change our design perspective, and how 3D printing products, rather than printing static components, ready-to-use movable mechanisms become a reality. Existing 3D printing solutions are challenged by precision limitations, and cannot directly produce tightly mated moving surfaces. Therefore, joints must be designed with a sufficient gap between the components, resulting in joints and other mechanisms with imprecise motion. In this study, we propose a bio-inspired printable joint and apply it to a Single sTep 3D-printed Prosthetic hand (ST3P hand). We simulate the anatomical structure of the human finger joint and implement a cam effect that changed the distance between the contact surfaces through the elastic bending of the ligaments as the joint flexed. This bio-inspired design allows the joint to be single-step 3D printed and provides precise motion. The bio-inspired printable joint makes it possible for the ST3P hand to be designed as a lightweight (∼255 g), low-cost (∼$500) monolithic structure with nine finger joints and manufactured via single-step 3D printing. The ST3P hand takes ∼6 min to assemble, which is approximately one-tenth the assembly time of open-source 3D printed prostheses.

37882785	Bioactive compounds (BCs) provide numerous health benefits by interacting with one or more components of living tissues and systems. However, despite their potential health benefits, most of the BCs have low bioaccessibility and bioavailability, hindering their potential health-promoting activities. The conventional encapsulation techniques are time-consuming and have major limitations in their food applications, including the use of non-food grade chemicals, undesired sensory attributes, and storage stability issues. A cutting-edge, new technique based on 3D printing can assist in resolving the problems associated with conventional encapsulation technologies. 3D food printing can help protect BCs by incorporating them precisely into three-dimensional matrices, which can provide (i) protection during storage, (ii) enhanced bioavailability, and (iii) effective delivery and controlled release of BCs. Recently, various 3D printing techniques and inks have been investigated in order to create delivery systems with different compositions and geometries, as well as diverse release patterns. This review emphasizes the advances in 3D printing-based encapsulation approaches, leading to enhanced delivery systems and customized food formulations.

37877389	"3D bioprinting technology is a rapidly developing technique that employs bioinks containing biological materials and living cells to construct biomedical products. However, 3D-printed tissues are static, while human tissues are in real-time dynamic states that can change in morphology and performance. To improve the compatibility between in vitro and in vivo environments, an in vitro tissue engineering technique that simulates this dynamic process is required. The concept of 4D printing, which combines ""3D printing + time"" provides a new approach to achieving this complex technique. 4D printing involves applying one or more smart materials that respond to stimuli, enabling them to change their shape, performance, and function under the corresponding stimulus to meet various needs.

37851509	Engineered living materials (ELMs) are a novel class of functional materials that typically feature spatial confinement of living components within an inert polymer matrix to recreate biological functions. Understanding the growth and spatial configuration of cellular populations within a matrix is crucial to predicting and improving their responsive potential and functionality. Here, this work investigates the growth, spatial distribution, and photosynthetic productivity of eukaryotic microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (C. reinhardtii) in three-dimensionally shaped hydrogels in dependence of geometry and size. The embedded C. reinhardtii cells photosynthesize and form confined cell clusters, which grow faster when located close to the ELM periphery due to favorable gas exchange and light conditions. Taking advantage of location-specific growth patterns, this work successfully designs and prints photosynthetic ELMs with increased CO2 capturing rate, featuring high surface to volume ratio. This strategy to control cell growth for higher productivity of ELMs resembles the already established adaptations found in multicellular plant leaves.

37815950	Bioprinting is an additive manufacturing process used to create architectures that mimic natural living tissues in form and function [1]. It involves the deposition of bioink, which can include a mixture of living cells, nutrients, and extracellular matrix. The bioink is then deposited onto a scaffold to generate 3-D structures that imitate natural tissues and organs. This process has already been used to generate a diverse range of products, including bioprinted human ears for transplant, and 3-D printed bioceramic and modified biopolymer bone implants that received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) marketing approval [2] Researchers are working on bioprinted versions of a wide range of organs, including liver, kidney, lung, and heart.

37805917	The sophisticated and complex haptonastic movements in response to environmental-stimuli of living organisms have always fascinated scientists. However, how to fundamentally mimic the sophisticated hierarchical architectures of living organisms to provide the artificial counterparts with similar or even beyond-natural functions based on the underlying mechanism remains a major scientific challenge. Here,  liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) artificial tendrils showing evolutionary biomimetic locomotion are developed following the structure-function principle that is used in nature to grow climbing plants. These elaborately designed tendril-like LCE actuators possess an asymmetric core-sheath architecture which shows a higher-to-lower transition in the degree of LC orientation from the sheath-to-core layer across the semi-ellipse cross-section. Upon heating and cooling, the LCE artificial tendril can undergo reversible tendril-like shape-morphing behaviors, such as helical coiling/winding, and perversion. The fundamental mechanism of the helical shape-morphing of the artificial tendril is revealed by using theoretical models and finite element simulations. Besides, the incorporation of metal-ligand coordination into the LCE network provides the artificial tendril with reconfigurable shape-morphing performances such as helical transitions and rotational deformations. Finally, the abilities of helical and rotational deformations are integrated into a new reprogrammed flagellum-like architecture to perform evolutionary locomotion mimicking the haptonastic movements of the natural flagellum.

37781048	Food printing using 3D, 4D, and 5D printing processes has received a lot of interest as a result of rising living standards and increased customer desire for new foods. In the food industry, 3D as well as 4D printing are extremely effective methods for additive manufacturing. The 3D printing technology produces flat objects with a variety of mechanical strengths. The strength of the object depends on the type of material used and the printing process. Printing structures with the most complex geometric, such as curved surfaces, necessitates the usage of supplementary material. The 4D printing procedure necessitates additional stimuli in order to adjust the aspect of the generated geometry. These obstacles can be addressed by employing 5D printing techniques, which prints the product in three motions and two rotational axes without the use of additional support material. These emerging innovations are likely to result in substantial advancements in all industries, including the manufacturing of high-quality food products. Food printing technology can be used to create long shelf-life products by printing food with protective coatings that prevent oxidation and degradation. Foods can also be printed in specific shapes or sizes to reduce surface area exposed to air. 6D printed objects can be created as a result of 5D printing because it is regarded as a by-product of 5D printing technology. 6D printing can save time and money by using the right processing parameters to create strong materials that are more sensitive to stimuli. 7D printing can enable more efficient production processes, reduce costs, and enable the development of products that are more complex and intricate than what is achievable with traditional manufacturing methods. The revolutionary change brought by food printing technologies in the field of applications, research and development, processing, advantages in food industry have been discussed in this paper.

37779379	Living materials that combine living cells and synthetic matrix materials have become promising research fields in recent years. While multicellular systems present exclusive benefits in developing living materials over single-cell systems, creating artificial multicellular systems can be challenging due to the difficulty in controlling the multicellular assemblies and the complexity of cell-to-cell interactions. Here, we propose a coculture platform capable of isolating and controlling the spatial distribution of algal-bacterial consortia, which can be utilized to construct photosynthetic living fibers. Through coaxial extrusion-based 3D printing, hydrogel fibers containing bacteria or algae can be deposited into designated structures and further processed into materials with precise geometries. In addition, the photosynthetic living fibers demonstrate a significant synergistic catalytic effect resulting from the immobilization of both bacteria and algae, which effectively optimizes sewage treatment for bioremediation purposes. The integration of microbial consortia and 3D printing yields functional living materials with promising applications in biocatalysis, biosensing, and biomedicine. Our approach provides an optimized solution for constructing efficient multicellular systems and opens a new avenue for the development of advanced materials.

37757814	Bioprinting is an additive manufacturing technique that combines living cells, biomaterials, and biological molecules to develop biologically functional constructs. Three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting is commonly used as anin vitromodeling system and is a more accurate representation ofin vivoconditions in comparison to two-dimensional cell culture. Although 3D bioprinting has been utilized in various tissue engineering and clinical applications, it only takes into consideration the initial state of the printed scaffold or object. Four-dimensional (4D) bioprinting has emerged in recent years to incorporate the additional dimension of time within the printed 3D scaffolds. During the 4D bioprinting process, an external stimulus is exposed to the printed construct, which ultimately changes its shape or functionality. By studying how the structures and the embedded cells respond to various stimuli, researchers can gain a deeper understanding of the functionality of native tissues. This review paper will focus on the biomaterial breakthroughs in the newly advancing field of 4D bioprinting and their applications in tissue engineering and regeneration. In addition, the use of smart biomaterials and 4D printing mechanisms for tissue engineering applications is discussed to demonstrate potential insights for novel 4D bioprinting applications. To address the current challenges with this technology, we will conclude with future perspectives involving the incorporation of biological scaffolds and self-assembling nanomaterials in bioprinted tissue constructs.

37754370	Temperature-controlled 3D cryoprinting (TCC) is an emerging tissue engineering technology aimed at overcoming limitations of conventional 3D printing for large organs: (a) size constraints due to low print rigidity and (b) the preservation of living cells during printing and subsequent tissue storage. TCC addresses these challenges by freezing each printed voxel with controlled cooling rates during deposition. This generates a rigid structure upon printing and ensures cell cryopreservation as an integral part of the process. Previous studies used alginate-based ink, which has limitations: (a) low diffusivity of the CaCl2 crosslinker during TCC's crosslinking process and (b) typical loss of print fidelity with alginate ink. This study explores the use of an ink made of agar and alginate to overcome TCC protocol limitations. When an agar/alginate voxel is deposited, agar first gels at above-freezing temperatures, capturing the desired structure without compromising fidelity, while alginate remains uncrosslinked. During subsequent freezing, both frozen agar and alginate maintain the structure. However, agar gel loses its gel form and water-retaining ability. In TCC, alginate crosslinking occurs by immersing the frozen structure in a warm crosslinking bath. This enables CaCl2 diffusion into the crosslinked alginate congruent with the melting process. Melted agar domains, with reduced water-binding ability, enhance crosslinker diffusivity, reducing TCC procedure duration. Additionally, agar overcomes the typical fidelity loss associated with alginate ink printing.

37750445	Photoinduced reversible deactivation radical polymerization (photo-RDRP) or photoinduced controlled/living radical polymerization has emerged as a versatile and powerful technique for preparing functional and advanced polymer materials under mild conditions by harnessing light energy. While UV and visible light (λ = 400-700 nm) are extensively employed in photo-RDRP, the utilization of near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths (λ = 700-2500 nm) beyond the visible region remains relatively unexplored. NIR light possesses unique properties, including enhanced light penetration, reduced light scattering, and low biomolecule absorption, thereby providing opportunities for applying photo-RDRP in the fields of manufacturing and medicine. This comprehensive review categorizes all known NIR light-induced RDRP (NIR-RDRP) systems into four mechanism-based types: mediation by upconversion nanoparticles, mediation by photocatalysts, photothermal conversion, and two-photon absorption. The distinct photoinitiation pathways associated with each mechanism are discussed. Furthermore, this review highlights the diverse applications of NIR-RDRP reported to date, including 3D printing, polymer brush fabrication, drug delivery, nanoparticle synthesis, and hydrogel formation. By presenting these applications, the review underscores the exceptional capabilities of NIR-RDRP and offers guidance for developing high-performance and versatile photopolymerization systems. Exploiting the unique properties of NIR light unlocks new opportunities for synthesizing functional and advanced polymer materials.

37714435	"Different types of ibuprofen-loaded, poly (D,L lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA)-based implants were prepared by 3D printing (Droplet Deposition Modeling). The theoretical filling density of the mesh-shaped implants was varied from 10 to 100%. Drug release was measured in agarose gels and in well agitated phosphate buffer pH 7.4. The key properties of the implants (and dynamic changes thereof upon exposure to the release media) were monitored using gravimetric measurements, optical microscopy, Differential Scanning Calorimetry, Gel Permeation Chromatography, and Scanning Electron Microscopy. Interestingly, drug release was similar for implants with 10 and 30% filling density, irrespective of the experimental set-up. In contrast, implants with 100% filling density showed slower release kinetics, and the shape of the release curve was altered in agarose gels. These observations could be explained by the existence (or absence) of a continuous aqueous phase between the polymeric filaments and the ""orchestrating role"" of substantial system swelling for the control of drug release. At lower filling densities, it is sufficient for the drug to be released from a single filament. In contrast, at high filling densities, the ensemble of filaments acts as a much larger (more or less homogeneous) polymeric matrix, and the average diffusion pathway to be overcome by the drug is much longer. Agarose gel (mimicking living tissue) hinders substantial PLGA swelling and delays the onset of the final rapid drug release phase. This improved mechanistic understanding of the control of drug release from PLGA-based 3D printed implants can help to facilitate the optimization of this type of advanced drug delivery systems."	3D printed PLGA implants: How the filling density affects drug release.	2023	Nov	Bassand C;Siepmann F;Benabed L;Verin J;Freitag J;Charlon S;Soulestin J;Siepmann J	3D printing;Drug release mechanism;Ibuprofen;Implant;PLGA;Swelling	Polylactic Acid-Polyglycolic Acid Copolymer;Drug Liberation;Polyglycolic Acid;Sepharose;Lactic Acid;Gels;Printing, Three-Dimensional;Drug Implants	Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society	Univ.

37691550	The convergence of 3D bioprinting with powerful manufacturing capability and cellular self-organization that can reproduce intricate tissue microarchitecture and function is a promising direction toward building functional tissues and has yet to be demonstrated. Here, we develop a granular aggregate-prevascularized (GAP) bioink for engineering highly vascularized bone tissues by capitalizing on the condensate-mimicking, self-organization, and angiogenic properties of prevascularized mesenchymal spheroids. The GAP bioink utilizes prevascularized aggregates as building blocks, which are embedded densely in extracellular matrices conducive to spontaneous self-organization. We printed various complex structures with high cell density (∼1.5 × 108 cells/cm3), viability (∼80%), and shape fidelity using GAP bioink. After printing, the prevascularized mesenchymal spheroids developed an interconnected vascular network through angiogenic sprouting. We printed highly vascularized bone tissues using GAP bioink and found that prevascularized spheroids were more conducive to osteogenesis and angiogenesis. We envision that the design of the GAP bioink could be further integrated with human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived organoids, which opens new avenues to create patient-specific vascularized tissues for therapeutic applications..

37691091	Diatoms have long been used as living biological indicators for the assessment of water quality in lakes and rivers worldwide. While this approach benefits from the great diversity of these unicellular algae, established protocols are time-consuming and require specialized equipment. Here, this work 3D prints diatom-laden hydrogels that can be used as a simple multiplex bio-indicator for water assessment. The hydrogel-based living materials are created with the help of a desktop extrusion-based printer using a suspension of diatoms, cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) and alginate as bio-ink constituents. Rheology and mechanical tests are employed to establish optimum bio-ink formulations, whereas cell culture experiments are utilized to evaluate the proliferation of the entrapped diatoms in the presence of selected water contaminants.

37683592	Hydrogels are three-dimensional polymer networks with hydrophilic properties. The modifiable properties of hydrogels and the structure resembling living tissue allow their versatile application. Therefore, increasing attention is focused on the use of hydrogels as bioinks for three-dimensional (3D) printing in tissue engineering. Bioprinting involves the fabrication of complex structures from several types of materials, cells, and bioactive compounds. Stem cells (SC), such as mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are frequently employed in 3D constructs. SCs have desirable biological properties such as the ability to differentiate into various types of tissue and high proliferative capacity. Encapsulating SCs in 3D hydrogel constructs enhances their reparative abilities and improves the likelihood of reaching target tissues. In addition, created constructs can simulate the tissue environment and mimic biological signals. Importantly, the immunogenicity of scaffolds is minimized through the use of patient-specific cells and the biocompatibility and biodegradability of the employed biopolymers. Regenerative medicine is taking advantage of the aforementioned capabilities in regenerating various tissues- muscle, bones, nerves, heart, skin, and cartilage.

37680065	Conductive hydrogels are promising materials with mixed ionic-electronic conduction to interface living tissue (ionic signal transmission) with medical devices (electronic signal transmission). The hydrogel form factor also uniquely bridges the wet/soft biological environment with the dry/hard environment of electronics. The synthesis of hydrogels for bioelectronics requires scalable, biocompatible fillers with high electronic conductivity and compatibility with common aqueous hydrogel formulations/resins. Despite significant advances in the processing of carbon nanomaterials, fillers that satisfy all these requirements are lacking. Herein, intrinsically dispersible acid-crystalized PEDOT:PSS nanoparticles (ncrys-PEDOTX ) are reported which are processed through a facile and scalable nonsolvent induced phase separation method from commercial PEDOT:PSS without complex instrumentation. The particles feature conductivities of up to 410 S cm-1 , and when compared to other common conductive fillers, display remarkable dispersibility, enabling homogeneous incorporation at relatively high loadings within diverse aqueous biomaterial solutions without additives or surfactants. The aqueous dispersibility of the ncrys-PEDOTX particles also allows simple incorporation into resins designed for microstereolithography without sonication or surfactant optimization; complex biomedical structures with fine features (< 150 µm) are printed with up to 10% particle loading . The ncrys-PEDOTX particles overcome the challenges of traditional conductive fillers, providing a scalable, biocompatible, plug-and-play platform for soft organic bioelectronic materials.

37655210	Reconstruction of bone defects remains a clinical challenge, and 3D bioprinting is a fabrication technology to treat it via tissue engineering. Collagen is currently the most popular cell scaffold for tissue engineering; however, a shortage of printability and low mechanical strength limited its application via 3D bioprinting. In the study, aiding with a gelatin support bath, a collagen-based scaffold was fabricated via 3D printing, where hydroxyapatite (HAP) and bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) were added to mimic the composition of bone. The results showed that the blend of HAP and collagen showed suitable rheological performance for 3D extrusion printing and enhanced the composite scaffold's strength. The gelatin support bath could effectively support the HAP/collagen scaffold's dimension with designed patterns at room temperature. BMSCs in/on the scaffold kept living and proliferating, and there was a high alkaline phosphate expression.

37639663	Syndrome of the Trephined (SoT) is a frequently misunderstood and underdiagnosed outcome of decompressive craniectomy, especially in cases of trauma. The pressure gradient between atmospheric pressure and the sub-atmospheric intracranial pressure results in a sinking of the scalp overlying the craniectomy site. This gradually compresses the underlying brain parenchyma. This parenchymal compression can disrupt normal autoregulation and subsequent metabolism, yielding symptoms ranging from headaches, dizziness, altered behavior to changes in sensation, and difficulty with ambulation, coordination, and activities of daily living. We present a case of SoT treated with a 3D-printed custom polycarbonate external cranial orthotic that allowed us to re-establish this pressure gradient by returning the cranium to a closed system.

37631383	Three-dimensional printing technology has been used for more than three decades in many industries, including the automotive and aerospace industries. So far, the use of this technology in medicine has been limited only to 3D printing of anatomical models for educational and training purposes, which is due to the insufficient functional properties of the materials used in the process. Only recent advances in the development of innovative materials have resulted in the flourishing of the use of 3D printing in medicine and pharmacy. Currently, additive manufacturing technology is widely used in clinical fields. Rapid development can be observed in the design of implants and prostheses, the creation of biomedical models tailored to the needs of the patient and the bioprinting of tissues and living scaffolds for regenerative medicine. The purpose of this review is to characterize the most popular 3D printing techniques.

37627795	The intensive development of technologies related to human health in recent years has caused a real revolution. The transition from conventional medicine to personalized medicine, largely driven by bioprinting, is expected to have a significant positive impact on a patient's quality of life. This article aims to conduct a systematic review of bioprinting's potential impact on health-related quality of life. A literature search was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A comprehensive literature search was undertaken using the PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, and ScienceDirect databases between 2019 and 2023. We have identified some of the most significant potential benefits of bioprinting to improve the patient's quality of life: personalized part production; saving millions of lives; reducing rejection risks after transplantation; accelerating the process of skin tissue regeneration; homocellular tissue model generation; precise fabrication process with accurate specifications; and eliminating the need for organs donor, and thus reducing patient waiting time. In addition, these advances in bioprinting have the potential to greatly benefit cancer treatment and other research, offering medical solutions tailored to each individual patient that could increase the patient's chance of survival and significantly improve their overall well-being. Although some of these advancements are still in the research stage, the encouraging results from scientific studies suggest that they are on the verge of being integrated into personalized patient treatment. The progress in bioprinting has the power to revolutionize medicine and healthcare, promising to have a profound impact on improving the quality of life and potentially transforming the field of medicine and healthcare.

37609940	Building prosthetics indistinguishable from human limbs to accurately receive and transmit sensory information to users not only promises to radically improve the lives of amputees, but also shows potential in a range of robotic applications. Currently, a mainstream approach is to embed electrical or optical sensors with force/thermal sensing functions on the surface or inside of prosthetic fingers. Compared with electrical sensing technologies, tactile sensors based on stretchable optical waveguides have the advantages of easy fabrication, chemical safety, environmental stability, and compatibility with prosthetic structural materials. However, so far, research has mainly focused on the perception of finger joint motion or external press, and there is still a lack of study on optical sensors with fingertip tactile capabilities (such as texture, hardness, slip detection, etc.). Here we report a 3D printing prosthetic finger with flexible chromatic optical waveguides implanted at the fingertip. The finger achieves distributed displacement/force sensing detection, and exhibits high sensitivity, fast response and good stability. The finger can be used to conduct active sensory experiments, and the detection parameters include object contour, hardness, slip direction and speed, temperature, etc. Finally, exploratory research on identifying and manipulating objects is carried out with this finger. The developed prosthetic finger can artificially recreate touch perception and realize complex functions such as note-writing analysis and braille recognition.

37584276	3D bioprinting is a versatile technique that allows the fabrication of living tissue analogs through the layer-by-layer deposition of cell-laden biomaterials, viz. bioinks. In this work, composite alginate hydrogel-based bioinks reinforced with curcumin-loaded particles of cellulose esters (CEpCUR) and laden with human keratinocytes (HaCaT) are developed. The addition of the CEpCUR particles, with sizes of 740 ± 147 nm, improves the rheological properties of the inks, increasing their shear stress and viscosity, while preserving the recovery rate and the mechanical and viscoelastic properties of the resulting fully cross-linked hydrogels. Moreover, the presence of these particles reduces the degradation rate of the hydrogels from 26.3 ± 0.8% (ALG) to 18.7 ± 1.3% (ALG:CEpCUR_10%) after 3 days in the culture medium. The 3D structures printed with the ALG:CEpCUR inks reveal increased printing definition and the ability to release curcumin (with nearly 70% of cumulative release after 24 h in PBS). After being laden with HaCaT cells (1.2 × 106 cells mL-1), the ALG:CEpCUR bioinks can be successfully 3D bioprinted, and the obtained living constructs show good dimensional stability and high cell viabilities at 7 days post-bioprinting (nearly 90%), confirming their great potential for application in fields like wound healing.

37569137	Food safety is a significant issue that affects people worldwide and is tied to their lives and health. The issue of pesticide residues in food is just one of many issues related to food safety, which leave residues in crops and are transferred through the food chain to human consumption. Foods contaminated with pesticide residues pose a serious risk to human health, including carcinogenicity, neurotoxicity, and endocrine disruption. Although traditional methods, including gas chromatography, high-performance liquid chromatography, chromatography, and mass spectrometry, can be used to achieve a quantitative analysis of pesticide residues, the disadvantages of these techniques, such as being time-consuming and costly and requiring specialist staff, limit their application. Therefore, there is a need to develop rapid, effective, and sensitive equipment for the quantitative analysis of pesticide residues in food. Microfluidics is rapidly emerging in a number of fields due to its outstanding strengths. This paper summarizes the application of microfluidic techniques to pyrethroid, carbamate, organochlorine, and organophosphate pesticides, as well as to commercial products. Meanwhile, the study also outlines the development of microfluidics in combination with 3D printing technology and nanomaterials for detecting pesticide residues in food.

37567703	Recreating the intricate mechanical and functional gradients found in natural tissues through additive manufacturing poses significant challenges, including the need for precise control over time and space and the availability of versatile biomaterial inks. In this proof-of-concept study, we developed a new biomaterial ink for direct ink writing, allowing the creation of 3D structures with tailorable functional and mechanical gradients. Our ink formulation combined multifunctional cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs), allyl-functionalized gelatin (0.8-2.0 wt%), and polyethylene glycol dithiol (3.0-7.5 wt%). The CNF served as a rheology modifier, whereas a concentration of 1.8 w/v % in the inks was chosen for optimal printability and shape fidelity. In addition, CNFs were functionalized with azido groups, enabling the spatial distribution of functional moieties within a 3D structure. These functional groups were further modified using a spontaneous click chemistry reaction. Through additive manufacturing and a readily available static mixer, we successfully demonstrated the fabrication of mechanical gradients - ranging from 3 to 6 kPa in indentation strength - and functional gradients. Additionally, we introduced dual gradients by combining gradient printing with an anisotropic photocrosslinking step. The developed biomaterial ink opens up possibilities for printing intricate multigradient structures, resembling the complex hierarchical organization seen in living tissues.

37566537	Bioprinting has attracted much attention due to its suitability for fabricating biomedical devices. In particular, bioprinting has become one of the growing centers in the field of wound healing, with various types of bioprinted devices being developed, including 3D scaffolds, microneedle patches, and flexible electronics. Bioprinted devices can be designed with specific biostructures and biofunctions that closely match the shape of wound sites and accelerate the regeneration of skin through various approaches. Herein, a comprehensive review of the bioprinting of smart wound dressings is presented, emphasizing the crucial effect of bioprinting in determining biostructures and biofunctions. The review begins with an overview of bioprinting techniques and bioprinted devices, followed with an in-depth discussion of polymer-based inks, modification strategies, additive ingredients, properties, and applications. The strategies for the modification of bioprinted devices are divided into seven categories, including chemical synthesis of novel inks, physical blending, coaxial bioprinting, multimaterial bioprinting, physical absorption, chemical immobilization, and hybridization with living cells, and examples are presented. Thereafter, the frontiers of bioprinting and wound healing, including 4D bioprinting, artificial intelligence-assisted bioprinting, and in situ bioprinting, are discussed from a perspective of interdisciplinary sciences. Finally, the current challenges and future prospects in this field are highlighted.

37550278	The field of engineered living materials lies at the intersection of materials science and synthetic biology with the aim of developing materials that can sense and respond to the environment. In this study, we use 3D printing to fabricate a cyanobacterial biocomposite material capable of producing multiple functional outputs in response to an external chemical stimulus and demonstrate the advantages of utilizing additive manufacturing techniques in controlling the shape of the fabricated photosynthetic material. As an initial proof-of-concept, a synthetic riboswitch is used to regulate the expression of a yellow fluorescent protein reporter in Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 within a hydrogel matrix. Subsequently, a strain of S. elongatus is engineered to produce an oxidative laccase enzyme; when printed within a hydrogel matrix the responsive biomaterial can decolorize a common textile dye pollutant, indigo carmine, potentially serving as a tool in environmental bioremediation. Finally, cells are engineered for inducible cell death to eliminate their presence once their activity is no longer required, which is an important function for biocontainment and minimizing environmental impact. By integrating genetically engineered stimuli-responsive cyanobacteria in volumetric 3D-printed designs, we demonstrate programmable photosynthetic biocomposite materials capable of producing functional outputs including, but not limited to, bioremediation.

37549505	Globally, there are 20 million adolescent girls and young women living with HIV who have limited access to long-acting, effective, women-controlled preventative methods. Additionally, although there are many contraceptive methods available, globally, half of all pregnancies remain unintended. Here we report the first 3D-printed multipurpose prevention technology (MPT) intravaginal ring (IVR) for HIV prevention and contraception. We utilized continuous liquid interface production (CLIP™) to fabricate MPT IVRs in a biocompatible silicone-based resin. Etonogestrel (ENG), ethinyl estradiol (EE), and islatravir (ISL) were loaded into the silicone poly(urethane) IVR in a controlled single step drug loading process driven by absorption. ENG/EE/ISL IVR promoted sustained release of drugs for 150 days in vitro and 14 days in sheep. There were no adverse MPT IVR-related findings of cervicovaginal toxicity or changes in vaginal biopsies or microbiome community profiles evaluated in sheep. Furthermore, ISL IVR in macaques promoted sustained release for 28 days with ISL-triphosphate levels above the established pharmacokinetic benchmark of 50-100 fmol/106 PBMCs. The ISL IVR was found to be safe and well tolerated in the macaques with no observed mucosal cytokine changes or alterations in peripheral CD4 T-cell populations. Collectively, the proposed MPT IVR has potential to expand preventative choices for young women and girls.

37542335	Active upper extremity (UE) assistive devices have the potential to restore independent functional movement in individuals with UE impairment due to neuromuscular diseases or injury-induced chronic weakness. Academically fabricated UE assistive devices are not usually optimized for activities of daily living (ADLs), whereas commercially available alternatives tend to lack flexibility in control and activation methods.

37540939	The multi-layered skin structure includes the epidermis, dermis and hypodermis, which forms a sophisticated tissue composed of extracellular matrix (ECM). The wound repair is a well-orchestrated process when the skin is injured. However, this natural wound repair will be ineffective for large surface area wounds. Autografts-based treatment is efficient but, additional pain and secondary healing of the patient limits its successful application. Therefore, there is a substantial need for fabricating tissue-engineered skin constructs. The development of a successful skin graft requires a fundamental understanding of the natural skin and its healing process, as well as design criteria for selecting a biopolymer and an appropriate fabrication technique. Further, the fabrication of an appropriate skin graft needs to meet physicochemical, mechanical, and biological properties equivalent to the natural skin. Advanced 3D bioprinting provides spatial control of the placement of functional components, such as biopolymers with living cells, which can satisfy the prerequisites for the preparation of an ideal skin graft. In this view, here we elaborate on the basic design requirements, constraints involved in the fabrication of skin graft and choice of ink, the probable solution by 3D bioprinting technique, as well as their latest advancements, challenges, and prospects.

37540781	Unimolecular (Type I) radical photoinitiators (PIs) have transformed the chemical manufacturing industry by enabling (stereo)lithography for microelectronics and emergent 3D printing technologies. However, the reliance on high energy UV-violet light (≤420 nm) restricts the end-use applications. Herein, boron-methylated dipyrromethene (methylated-BODIPY) is shown to act as a highly efficient Type I radical PI upon irradiation with low energy green light. Using a low intensity (∼4 mW/cm2) light emitting diode centered at 530 nm and a low PI concentration (0.3 mol %), acrylic-based resins were polymerized to maximum conversion in ∼10 s. Under equivalent conditions (wavelength, intensity, and PI concentration), state-of-the-art visible light PIs Ivocerin and Irgacure 784 show no appreciable polymerization. Spectroscopic characterization suggests that homolytic β-scission at the boron-carbon bond results in radical formation, which is further facilitated by accessing long-lived triplet excited states through installment of bromine. Alkylated-BODIPYs represent a new modular visible light PI platform with exciting potential to enable next generation manufacturing and biomedical applications where a spectrally discrete, low energy, and thus benign light source is required.

37531332	Additive manufacturing, or 3D printing, has revolutionized the way we create objects. However, its layer-by-layer process may lead to an increased incidence of local defects compared to traditional casting-based methods. Factors such as light intensity, depth of light penetration, component inhomogeneity, and fluctuations in nozzle temperature all contribute to defect formations. These defective regions can become sources of toxic component leakage, but pinpointing their locations in 3D printed materials remains a challenge. Traditional toxicological assessments rely on the extraction and subsequent exposure of living organisms to these harmful agents, thus only offering a passive detection approach. Therefore, the development of an active system to both identify and locate sources of toxicity is essential in the realm of 3D printing technologies. Herein, we introduce the use of the nematode model organism, Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans), for toxicity evaluation. C. elegans exhibits distinctive 'sensing' and 'locomotion' capabilities that enable it to actively navigate toward safe zones while steering clear of hazardous areas. This active behavior sets C. elegans apart from other aquatic and animal models, making it an exceptional choice for immediate and precise identification and localization of toxicity sources in 3D printed materials.

37514150	Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) developed by microorganisms is considered one of the most critical public health issues worldwide. This problem is affecting the lives of millions of people and needs to be addressed promptly. Mainly, antibiotics are the substances that contribute to AMR in various strains of bacteria and other microorganisms, leading to infectious diseases that cannot be effectively treated. To avoid the use of antibiotics and similar drugs, several approaches have gained attention in the fields of materials science and engineering as well as pharmaceutics over the past five years. Our focus lies on the design and manufacture of polymeric-based materials capable of incorporating antimicrobial agents excluding the aforementioned substances. In this sense, two of the emerging techniques for materials fabrication, namely, electrospinning and 3D printing, have gained significant attraction. In this article, we provide a summary of the most important findings that contribute to the development of antimicrobial systems using these technologies to incorporate various types of nanomaterials, organic molecules, or natural compounds with the required property. Furthermore, we discuss and consider the challenges that lie ahead in this research field for the coming years.

37509098	Hydrogels have been widely applied to the fabrication of tissue engineering scaffolds via three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting because of their extracellular matrix-like properties, capacity for living cell encapsulation, and shapeable customization depending on the defect shape. However, the current hydrogel scaffolds show limited regeneration activity, especially in the application of periodontal tissue regeneration. In this study, we attempted to develop a novel multi-component hydrogel that possesses good biological activity, can wrap living cells for 3D bioprinting and can regenerate periodontal soft and hard tissue. The multi-component hydrogel consisted of gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA), sodium alginate (SA) and bioactive glass microsphere (BGM), which was first processed into hydrogel scaffolds by cell-free 3D printing to evaluate its printability and in vitro biological performances. The cell-free 3D-printed scaffolds showed uniform porous structures and good swelling capability. The BGM-loaded scaffold exhibited good biocompatibility, enhanced osteogenic differentiation, apatite formation abilities and desired mechanical strength. The composite hydrogel was further applied as a bio-ink to load with mouse bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (mBMSCs) and growth factors (BMP2 and PDGF) for the fabrication of a scaffold for periodontal tissue regeneration. The cell wrapped in the hydrogel still maintained good cellular vitality after 3D bioprinting and showed enhanced osteogenic differentiation and soft tissue repair capabilities in BMP2- and PDGF-loaded scaffolds. It was noted that after transplantation of the cell- and growth factor-laden scaffolds in Beagle dog periodontal defects, significant regeneration of gingival tissue, periodontal ligament, and alveolar bone was detected. Importantly, a reconstructed periodontal structure was established in the treatment group eight weeks post-transplantation of the scaffolds containing the cell and growth factors. In conclusion, we developed a bioactive composite bio-ink for the fabrication of scaffolds applicable for the reconstruction and regeneration of periodontal tissue defects.	3D Bioprinting of a Bioactive Composite Scaffold for Cell Delivery in Periodontal Tissue Regeneration.	2023	Jun	Miao Guohou;Liang Liyu;Li Wenzhi;Ma Chaoyang;Pan Yuqian;Zhao Hongling;Zhang Qing;Xiao Yin;Yang Xuechao	3D bioprinting;cell-laden scaffold;composite hydrogel;periodontal regeneration	Animals;Mice;Dogs;Osteogenesis;Bioprinting;Tissue Engineering;Tissue Scaffolds;Hydrogels	Biomolecules	Guangzhou Key Laboratory of Basic and Applied Research of Oral Regenerative Medicine, Affiliated Stomatology Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangdong Engineering Research Center of Oral Restoration and Reconstruction, Guangzhou 510182, China.;School and Hospital of Stomatology, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou 510182, China.;Hospital of Stomatology, Zhongshan 528404, China.;Guangzhou Key Laboratory of Basic and Applied Research of Oral Regenerative Medicine, Affiliated Stomatology Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangdong Engineering Research Center of Oral Restoration and Reconstruction, Guangzhou 510182, China.;School and Hospital of Stomatology, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou 510182, China.;Guangzhou Key Laboratory of Basic and Applied Research of Oral Regenerative Medicine, Affiliated Stomatology Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangdong Engineering Research Center of Oral Restoration and Reconstruction, Guangzhou 510182, China.;School and Hospital of Stomatology, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou 510182, China.;Guangzhou Key Laboratory of Basic and Applied Research of Oral Regenerative Medicine, Affiliated Stomatology Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangdong Engineering Research Center of Oral Restoration and Reconstruction, Guangzhou 510182, China.;School and Hospital of Stomatology, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou 510182, China.;Guangzhou Key Laboratory of Basic and Applied Research of Oral Regenerative Medicine, Affiliated Stomatology Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangdong Engineering Research Center of Oral Restoration and Reconstruction, Guangzhou 510182, China.;School and Hospital of Stomatology, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou 510182, China.;Guangzhou Key Laboratory of Basic and Applied Research of Oral Regenerative Medicine, Affiliated Stomatology Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangdong Engineering Research Center of Oral Restoration and Reconstruction, Guangzhou 510182, China.;School and Hospital of Stomatology, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou 510182, China.;Laboratory for Myology, Department of Human Movement Sciences, Faculty of Behavioral and Movement Sciences, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Amsterdam Movement Sciences, 1081 BT Amsterdam, The Netherlands.;Guangzhou Key Laboratory of Basic and Applied Research of Oral Regenerative Medicine, Affiliated Stomatology Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangdong Engineering Research Center of Oral Restoration and Reconstruction, Guangzhou 510182, China.;School of Medicine and Dentistry, Menzies Health Institute Queensland, Griffith University, Gold Coast, QLD 4222, Australia.;The Australia-China Centre for Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine (ACCTERM), Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, QLD 4000, Australia.;Guangzhou Key Laboratory of Basic and Applied Research of Oral Regenerative Medicine, Affiliated Stomatology Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangdong Engineering Research Center of Oral Restoration and Reconstruction, Guangzhou 510182, China.;School and Hospital of Stomatology, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou 510182, China.

37508814	"To investigate the pathogenic mechanisms of calcified aortic valve disease (CAVD), it is necessary to develop a new three-dimensional model that contains valvular interstitial cells (VIC) and valvular endothelial cells (VEC). For this purpose, ovine aortic valves were processed to isolate VIC and VEC that were dissolved in an alginate/gelatin hydrogel. A 3D-bioprinter (3D-Bioplotter® Developer Series, EnvisionTec, Gladbeck, Germany) was used to print cell-laden tissue constructs containing VIC and VEC which were cultured for up to 21 days. The 3D-architecture, the composition of the culture medium, and the hydrogels were modified, and cell viability was assessed. The composition of the culture medium directly affected the cell viability of the multicellular tissue constructs. Co-culture of VIC and VEC with a mixture of 70% valvular interstitial cell and 30% valvular endothelial cell medium components reached the cell viability best tested with about 60% more living cells compared to pure valvular interstitial cell medium (p = 0.02). The tissue constructs retained comparable cell viability after 21 days (p = 0.90) with different 3D-architectures, including a ""sandwich"" and a ""tube"" design. Good long-term cell viability was confirmed even for thick multilayer multicellular tissue constructs. The 3D-bioprinting of multicellular tissue constructs with VEC and VIC is a successful new technique to design tissue constructs that mimic the structure of the native aortic valve for research applications of aortic valve pathologies."

37501547	Background: We used antibiotic-impregnated polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) bone cement to make a patient-specific radial head prosthesis (RHP) by applying the 3-dimensional (3D) designing technique in patients with Mason types 3 and 4 radial head fractures. The aim of this study is to report the short- to mid-term outcomes of this procedure. Methods: This is a prospective study of all patients who underwent a patient-specific PMMA bone cement RHP at our institute over a 1-year period from May 2017 to June 2018. The outcome measures included range of motion, grip strength, visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain at rest and at activity, disabilities of arm, shoulder and hand (DASH) score and Mayo elbow performance index (MEPI). Radiographs of the elbow ere obtained at final follow-up and any complications were also recorded. Results: Our study included eight patients with a mean follow-up of 18 months (13-20 months). The mean arc of extension-flexion and supination-pronation of the operated side was 86% and 96% of the unaffected side, respectively. Mean grip strength was 86% of the unaffected side. The mean VAS for pain at rest was 0 and during activity was 2 out of 10. The mean DASH score was 8 out of 100 (0-22), showing minimal disability and ability to cope with most living activities. MEPI showed four excellent, three good and one fair result. One patient complained of proximal forearm pain that appeared 1 year after surgery. No patient complained of ulnar nerve symptoms requiring intervention. No RHP was removed during the follow-up. Conclusions: PMMA RHP can be used safely as an alternative to metal prostheses to restore valgus and axial stability of the forearm. The use of 3D printing optimised the design and surgical technique of radial head arthroplasty, and we need further studies to assess the long-term follow-ups.

37501325	Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have significantly impacted the daily lives, finding broad applications in various industries such as consumer electronics, electric vehicles, medical devices, aerospace, and power tools. However, they still face issues (i.e., safety due to dendrite propagation, manufacturing cost, random porosities, and basic & planar geometries) that hinder their widespread applications as the demand for LIBs rapidly increases in all sectors due to their high energy and power density values compared to other batteries. Additive manufacturing (AM) is a promising technique for creating precise and programmable structures in energy storage devices. This review first summarizes light, filament, powder, and jetting-based 3D printing methods with the status on current trends and limitations for each AM technology. The paper also delves into 3D printing-enabled electrodes (both anodes and cathodes) and solid-state electrolytes for LIBs, emphasizing the current state-of-the-art materials, manufacturing methods, and properties/performance. Additionally, the current challenges in the AM for electrochemical energy storage (EES) applications, including limited materials, low processing precision, codesign/comanufacturing concepts for complete battery printing, machine learning (ML)/artificial intelligence (AI) for processing optimization and data analysis, environmental risks, and the potential of 4D printing in advanced battery applications, are also presented.	3D Printing-Enabled Design and Manufacturing Strategies for Batteries: A Review.	2023	Dec	Fonseca Nathan;Thummalapalli Sri Vaishnavi;Jambhulkar Sayli;Ravichandran Dharneedar;Zhu Yuxiang;Patil Dhanush;Thippanna Varunkumar;Ramanathan Arunachalam;Xu Weiheng;Guo Shenghan;Ko Hyunwoong;Fagade Mofe;Kannan Arunchala M;Nian Qiong;Asadi Amir;Miquelard-Garnier Guillaume;Dmochowska Anna;Hassan Mohammad K;Al-Ejji Maryam;El-Dessouky Hassan M;Stan Felicia;Song Kenan	3D printing;batteries;electrodes;hierarchies;multimaterials;solid electrolytes		Small (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)	Manufacturing Engineering, School of Manufacturing Systems and Networks (MSN), Ira A.

37489648	Designing functional, vascularized, human scale in vitro models with biomimetic architectures and multiple cell types is a highly promising strategy for both a better understanding of natural tissue/organ development stages to inspire regenerative medicine, and to test novel therapeutics on personalized microphysiological systems. Extrusion-based 3D bioprinting is an effective biofabrication technology to engineer living constructs with predefined geometries and cell patterns. However, bioprinting high-resolution multilayered structures with mechanically weak hydrogel bioinks is challenging. The advent of embedded 3D bioprinting systems in recent years offered new avenues to explore this technology for in vitro modeling. By providing a stable, cell-friendly and perfusable environment to hold the bioink during and after printing, it allows to recapitulate native tissues' architecture and function in a well-controlled manner.

37463509	Assistive devices are designed to enhance individuals with disabilities' functional abilities. The rise of 3D printing technology enabled the production of individualized assistive devices (IADs). A REHAB-LAB is intended for IAD provision involving technical referents and occupational therapists. This study aimed to develop the REHAB-LAB logic model; to explore its fidelity and desirability; and to explore the characteristics of arising initiatives of IAD production. The REHAB-LAB logic model development involved stakeholders throughout the research process. A pragmatic multimethod approach followed two phases 1) logic model development and 2) exploration of its fidelity and desirability. The REHAB-LAB logic model presented the resources (equipment, space, human) required to implement IAD provision in a rehabilitation center, and the expected deliverables (activities and outputs). The REHAB-LAB logic model highlights the interdisciplinarity of IAD provision including occupational therapists, doctors, engineers, managers, and technical referents and places the users at the center of the IAD production. Results confirmed the fidelity and desirability of the REHAB-LAB logic model. The REHAB-LAB logic model can be used as a reference for future healthcare organizations wishing to implement an IAD provision. This research highlighted the interest of IAD provision based on the REHAB-LAB model involving users and transdisciplinary practices.

37435177	Bioinks are formulations of biomaterials and living cells, sometimes with growth factors or other biomolecules, while extrusion bioprinting is an emerging technique to apply or deposit these bioinks or biomaterial solutions to create three-dimensional (3D) constructs with architectures and mechanical/biological properties that mimic those of native human tissue or organs. Printed constructs have found wide applications in tissue engineering for repairing or treating tissue/organ injuries, as well as in vitro tissue modelling for testing or validating newly developed therapeutics and vaccines prior to their use in humans. Successful printing of constructs and their subsequent applications rely on the properties of the formulated bioinks, including the rheological, mechanical, and biological properties, as well as the printing process. This article critically reviews the latest developments in bioinks and biomaterial solutions for extrusion bioprinting, focusing on bioink synthesis and characterization, as well as the influence of bioink properties on the printing process. Key issues and challenges are also discussed along with recommendations for future research.

37429822	Polymerization induced microphase separation (PIMS) is a strategy used to develop unique nanostructures with highly useful morphologies through the microphase separation of emergent block copolymers during polymerization. In this process, nanostructures are formed with at least two chemically independent domains, where at least one domain is composed of a robust crosslinked polymer. Crucially, this synthetically simple method is readily used to develop nanostructured materials with the highly coveted co-continuous morphology, which can also be converted into mesoporous materials by selective etching of one domain. As PIMS exploits a block copolymer microphase separation mechanism, the size of each domain can be tightly controlled by modifying the size of block copolymer precursors, thus providing unparalleled control over nanostructure and resultant mesopore sizes. Since its inception 11 years ago, PIMS has been used to develop a vast inventory of advanced materials for an extensive range of applications including biomedical devices, ion exchange membranes, lithium-ion batteries, catalysis, 3D printing, and fluorescence-based sensors, among many others. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the PIMS process, summarize latest developments in PIMS chemistry, and discuss its utility in a wide variety of relevant applications.

37429291	Three-dimensional bioprinting has emerged as an appealing approach for creating functional tissues; however, a lack of suitable bioinks with high cell density and printability has greatly limited our ability to print functional tissues. We address this limitation by developing a granular cell aggregate-based biphasic (GCAB) bioink based on densely packed cell aggregates. The GCAB bioink exhibited the desired shear-thinning and shear-recovery properties for extrusion bioprinting and hyperelastic behaviors postprinting for modeling the mechanical characteristics of soft biological tissues. The GCAB bioink displayed a high cell density (∼1.7 × 108cells cm-3) without compromising viability (∼83%). We printed dense hepatic tissue constructs with enhanced vascularization and metabolic functions by preorganization of GCAB bioink with a defined heterogeneous microenvironment. By simultaneously printing the GCAB bioink and an endothelial cell-laden gelatin bioink, we successfully produced functional hepatic tissues with a high cell density and a perfusable vascular network. The design of the generalizable GCAB bioink opens new avenues to create functional tissues for therapeutic applications.	3D printing of vascularized hepatic tissues with a high cell density and heterogeneous microenvironment.	2023	Jul	Fang Yongcong;Ji Mengke;Yang Yi;Guo Yihan;Sun Ruobin;Zhang Ting;Sun Wei;Xiong Zhuo	3D bioprinting;bioink;spheroids;tissue engineering;vascularization	Tissue Scaffolds;Tissue Engineering;Bioprinting;Printing, Three-Dimensional;Gelatin	Biofabrication	Biomanufacturing Center, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, People's Republic of China.;Biomanufacturing and Rapid Forming Technology Key Laboratory of Beijing, Beijing 100084, People's Republic of China.;'Biomanufacturing and Engineering Living Systems' Innovation International Talents Base (111 Base), Beijing 100084, People's Republic of China.;Biomanufacturing Center, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, People's Republic of China.;Biomanufacturing and Rapid Forming Technology Key Laboratory of Beijing, Beijing 100084, People's Republic of China.;'Biomanufacturing and Engineering Living Systems' Innovation International Talents Base (111 Base), Beijing 100084, People's Republic of China.;Biomanufacturing Center, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, People's Republic of China.;Biomanufacturing and Rapid Forming Technology Key Laboratory of Beijing, Beijing 100084, People's Republic of China.;'Biomanufacturing and Engineering Living Systems' Innovation International Talents Base (111 Base), Beijing 100084, People's Republic of China.;Biomanufacturing Center, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, People's Republic of China.;Biomanufacturing and Rapid Forming Technology Key Laboratory of Beijing, Beijing 100084, People's Republic of China.;'Biomanufacturing and Engineering Living Systems' Innovation International Talents Base (111 Base), Beijing 100084, People's Republic of China.;Biomanufacturing Center, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, People's Republic of China.;Biomanufacturing and Rapid Forming Technology Key Laboratory of Beijing, Beijing 100084, People's Republic of China.;'Biomanufacturing and Engineering Living Systems' Innovation International Talents Base (111 Base), Beijing 100084, People's Republic of China.;Biomanufacturing Center, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, People's Republic of China.;Biomanufacturing and Rapid Forming Technology Key Laboratory of Beijing, Beijing 100084, People's Republic of China.;'Biomanufacturing and Engineering Living Systems' Innovation International Talents Base (111 Base), Beijing 100084, People's Republic of China.;Biomanufacturing Center, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, People's Republic of China.;Biomanufacturing and Rapid Forming Technology Key Laboratory of Beijing, Beijing 100084, People's Republic of China.;'Biomanufacturing and Engineering Living Systems' Innovation International Talents Base (111 Base), Beijing 100084, People's Republic of China.;Department of Mechanical Engineering, Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA 19104, United States of America.;Biomanufacturing Center, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, People's Republic of China.;Biomanufacturing and Rapid Forming Technology Key Laboratory of Beijing, Beijing 100084, People's Republic of China.;'Biomanufacturing and Engineering Living Systems' Innovation International Talents Base (111 Base), Beijing 100084, People's Republic of China.

37403962	New developments in additive manufacturing and regenerative medicine have the potential to radically disrupt the traditional pipelines of therapy development and medical device manufacture. These technologies present a challenge for regulators because traditional regulatory frameworks are designed for mass manufactured therapies, rather than bespoke solutions. 3D bioprinting technologies present another dimension of complexity through the inclusion of living cells in the fabrication process. Herein we overview the challenge of regulating 3D bioprinting in comparison to existing cell therapy products as well as custom-made 3D printed medical devices.

37371837	Three-dimensional bioprinting is the process of manipulating cell-laden bioinks to fabricate living structures. Three-dimensional bioprinting techniques have brought considerable innovation in biomedicine, especially in the field of tissue engineering, allowing the production of 3D organ and tissue models for in vivo transplantation purposes or for in-depth and precise in vitro analyses. Naturally derived hydrogels, especially those obtained from the decellularization of biological tissues, are promising bioinks for 3D printing purposes, as they present the best biocompatibility characteristics. Despite this, many natural hydrogels do not possess the necessary mechanical properties to allow a simple and immediate application in the 3D printing process. In this review, we focus on the bioactive and mechanical characteristics that natural hydrogels may possess to allow efficient production of organs and tissues for biomedical applications, emphasizing the reinforcement techniques to improve their biomechanical properties.

37370618	Additive manufacturing (3D printing) and computer-aided design (CAD) still have limited uptake in biomedical and bioengineering research and education, despite the significant potential of these technologies. The utility of organ-scale 3D-printed models of living structures is widely appreciated, while the workflows for microscopy data translation into tactile accessible replicas are not well developed yet. Here, we demonstrate an accessible and reproducible CAD-based methodology for generating 3D-printed scalable models of human cells cultured in vitro and imaged using conventional scanning confocal microscopy with fused deposition modeling (FDM) 3D printing. We termed this technology CiTo-3DP (Cells-in-Touch for 3D Printing). As a proof-of-concept, we created dismountable CiTo-3DP models of human epithelial, mesenchymal, and neural cells by using selectively stained nuclei and cytoskeletal components. We also provide educational and research context for the presented cellular models. In the future, the CiTo-3DP approach can be adapted to different imaging and 3D printing modalities and comprehensively present various cell types, subcellular structures, and extracellular matrices. The resulting CAD and 3D printed models could be used for a broad spectrum of education and research applications.

37366852	The construction industry makes a significant contribution to global CO2 emissions. Material extraction, processing, and demolition account for most of its environmental impact. As a response, there is an increasing interest in developing and implementing innovative biomaterials that support a circular economy, such as mycelium-based composites. The mycelium is the network of hyphae of fungi. Mycelium-based composites are renewable and biodegradable biomaterials obtained by ceasing mycelial growth on organic substrates, including agricultural waste. Cultivating mycelium-based composites within molds, however, is often wasteful, especially if molds are not reusable or recyclable. Shaping mycelium-based composites using 3D printing can minimize mold waste while allowing intricate forms to be fabricated. In this research, we explore the use of waste cardboard as a substrate for cultivating mycelium-based composites and the development of extrudable mixtures and workflows for 3D-printing mycelium-based components. In this paper, existing research on the use of mycelium-based material in recent 3D printing efforts was reviewed. This review is followed by the MycoPrint experiments that we conducted, and we focus on the main challenges that we faced (i.e., contamination) and the ways in which we addressed them. The results of this research demonstrate the feasibility of using waste cardboard as a substrate for cultivating mycelia and the potential for developing extrudable mixtures and workflows for 3D-printing mycelium-based components.

37353904	3D bioprinting has developed tremendously in the last couple of years and enables the fabrication of simple, as well as complex, tissue models. The international space agencies have recognized the unique opportunities of these technologies for manufacturing cell and tissue models for basic research in space, in particular for investigating the effects of microgravity and cosmic radiation on different types of human tissues. In addition, bioprinting is capable of producing clinically applicable tissue grafts, and its implementation in space therefore can support the autonomous medical treatment options for astronauts in future long term and far-distant space missions. The article discusses opportunities but also challenges of operating different types of bioprinters under space conditions, mainly in microgravity. While some process steps, most of which involving the handling of liquids, are challenging under microgravity, this environment can help overcome problems such as cell sedimentation in low viscous bioinks. Hopefully, this publication will motivate more researchers to engage in the topic, with publicly available bioprinting opportunities becoming available at the International Space Station (ISS) in the imminent future.	3D Bioprinting in Microgravity: Opportunities, Challenges, and Possible Applications in Space.	2023	Sep	Van Ombergen Angelique;Chalupa-Gantner Franziska;Chansoria Parth;Colosimo Bianca Maria;Costantini Marco;Domingos Marco;Dufour Alexandre;De Maria Carmelo;Groll Jürgen;Jungst Tomasz;Levato Riccardo;Malda Jos;Margarita Alessandro;Marquette Christophe;Ovsianikov Aleksandr;Petiot Emma;Read Sophia;Surdo Leonardo;Swieszkowski Wojciech;Vozzi Giovanni;Windisch Johannes;Zenobi-Wong Marcy;Gelinsky Michael	additive manufacturing;biofabrication;low Earth orbit - LEO;space	Humans;Weightlessness;Space Flight;Bioprinting;Cosmic Radiation;Printing, Three-Dimensional	Advanced healthcare materials	"SciSpacE Team, Directorate of Human and Robotic Exploration Programmes (HRE), European Space Agency (ESA), Keplerlaan 1, Noordwijk, 2201AG, The Netherlands.;ESA Topical Team on ""3D Bioprinting of living tissue for utilization in space exploration and extraterrestrial human settlements"", 01307, Dresden, Germany.;Research Group 3D Printing and Biofabrication, Institute of Materials Science and Technology, Austrian Cluster for Tissue Regeneration, TU Wien, Getreidemarkt 9/E308, Vienna, 1060, Austria.;Tissue Engineering + Biofabrication Laboratory, Department of Health Sciences and Technology, ETH Zurich Otto-Stern-Weg 7, Zürich, 8093, Switzerland.;ESA Topical Team on ""3D Bioprinting of living tissue for utilization in space exploration and extraterrestrial human settlements"", 01307, Dresden, Germany.;Department of Mechanical Engineering, Politecnico di Milano, Via La Masa 1, Milano, 20156, Italy.;Institute of Physical Chemistry, Polish Academy of Sciences, Ul.

37341642	Live biotherapeutic products (LBPs) are an emerging class of therapeutics comprised of engineered living organisms such as bacteria or yeast. Bioprinting with living materials has now become possible using modern three-dimensional (3D) printing strategies. While there has been significant progress in bioprinting cells, bioprinting LBPs, specifically yeast, remains in its infancy and has not been optimized. Yeasts are a promising platform to develop into protein biofactories because they (1) grow rapidly, (2) are easy to engineer and manufacture, and (3) are inexpensive to produce. Here we developed an optimized method for loading yeast into hydrogel patches using digital light processing (DLP) 3D printing. We assessed the effects of patch geometry, bioink composition, and yeast concentration on yeast viability, patch stability, and protein release, and in doing so developed a patch formulation capable of supporting yeast growth and sustained protein release for at least ten days.

37323491	48With the growing number of biomaterials and printing technologies, bioprinting has brought about tremendous potential to fabricate biomimetic architectures or living tissue constructs. To make bioprinting and bioprinted constructs more powerful, machine learning (ML) is introduced to optimize the relevant processes, applied materials, and mechanical/biological performances. The objectives of this work were to collate, analyze, categorize, and summarize published articles and papers pertaining to ML applications in bioprinting and their impact on bioprinted constructs, as well as the directions of potential development. From the available references, both traditional ML and deep learning (DL) have been applied to optimize the printing process, structural parameters, material properties, and biological/mechanical performance of bioprinted constructs. The former uses features extracted from image or numerical data as inputs in prediction model building, and the latter uses the image directly for segmentation or classification model building. All of these studies present advanced bioprinting with a stable and reliable printing process, desirable fiber/droplet diameter, and precise layer stacking, and also enhance the bioprinted constructs with better design and cell performance. The current challenges and outlooks in developing process-material-performance models are highlighted, which may pave the way for revolutionizing bioprinting technologies and bioprinted construct design.

37319328	Soft tissue defects or pathologies frequently necessitate the use of biomaterials that provide the volume required for subsequent vascularization and tissue formation as autrografts are not always a feasible alternative. Supramolecular hydrogels represent promising candidates because of their 3D structure, which resembles the native extracellular matrix, and their capacity to entrap and sustain living cells. Guanosine-based hydrogels have emerged as prime candidates in recent years since the nucleoside self-assembles into well-ordered structures like G-quadruplexes by coordinating K+ ions and π-π stacking, ultimately forming an extensive nanofibrillar network. However, such compositions were frequently inappropriate for 3D printing due to material spreading and low shape stability over time. Thus, the present work aimed to develop a binary cell-laden hydrogel capable of ensuring cell survival while providing enough stability to ensure scaffold biointegration during soft tissue reconstruction. For that purpose, a binary hydrogel made of guanosine and guanosine 5'-monophosphate was optimized, rat mesenchymal stem cells were entrapped, and the composition was bioprinted. To further increase stability, the printed structure was coated with hyperbranched polyethylenimine. Scanning electron microscopic studies demonstrated an extensive nanofibrillar network, indicating excellent G-quadruplex formation, and rheological analysis confirmed good printing and thixotropic qualities. Additionally, diffusion tests using fluorescein isothiocyanate labeled-dextran (70, 500, and 2000 kDa) showed that nutrients of various molecular weights may diffuse through the hydrogel scaffold. Finally, cells were evenly distributed throughout the printed scaffold, cell survival was 85% after 21 days, and lipid droplet formation was observed after 7 days under adipogenic conditions, indicating successful differentiation and proper cell functioning. To conclude, such hydrogels may enable the 3D bioprinting of customized scaffolds perfectly matching the respective soft tissue defect, thereby potentially improving the outcome of the tissue reconstruction intervention.

37314069	Repairing full-thickness skin defects is a major challenge in clinical practice. Three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting of living cells and biomaterials is a promising technique to resolve this challenge. However, the time-consuming preparation and limited sources of biomaterials are bottlenecks that must be addressed. Therefore, we developed a simple and fast method to directly process adipose tissue into a microfragmented adipose extracellular matrix (mFAECM) as the main component of bioink to fabricate 3D-bioprinted, biomimetic, multilayer implants. The mFAECM retained most of the collagen and sulfated glycosaminoglycans in the native tissue. In vitro, the mFAECM composite demonstrated biocompatibility, printability, and fidelity and could support cell adhesion. In a full-thickness skin defect model in nude mice, cells encapsulated in the implant survived and participated in wound repair after implantation. The basic structures of the implant were maintained throughout wound healing and gradually metabolized. The biomimetic multilayer implants fabricated via mFAECM composite bioinks and cells could accelerate wound healing by promoting the contraction of new tissue inside the wound, collagen secretion and remodeling, and neovascularization. This study provides an approach for improving the timeliness of fabricating 3D-bioprinted skin substitutes and may offer a useful tool for treating full-thickness skin defects.	3D-Bioprinted Biomimetic Multilayer Implants Comprising Microfragmented Adipose Extracellular Matrix and Cells Improve Wound Healing in a Murine Model of Full-Thickness Skin Defects.	2023	Jun	Zhang Dequan;Lai Linying;Fu Huijuan;Fu Qiang;Chen Minliang	3D bioprinting;full-thickness skin defects;microfragmented adipose extracellular matrix;wound healing	Mice;Animals;Wound Healing;Mice, Nude;Disease Models, Animal;Biomimetics;Extracellular Matrix;Collagen;Bioprinting;Biocompatible Materials;Tissue Engineering;Printing, Three-Dimensional;Tissue Scaffolds	ACS applied materials & interfaces	Senior Department of Burns and Plastic Surgery, Fourth Medical Center of PLA General Hospital, Beijing 100048, China.;Central Medical Branch of PLA General Hospital, Beijing 100120, China.;Senior Department of Burns and Plastic Surgery, Fourth Medical Center of PLA General Hospital, Beijing 100048, China.;Senior Department of Burns and Plastic Surgery, Fourth Medical Center of PLA General Hospital, Beijing 100048, China.;Senior Department of Burns and Plastic Surgery, Fourth Medical Center of PLA General Hospital, Beijing 100048, China.;Senior Department of Burns and Plastic Surgery, Fourth Medical Center of PLA General Hospital, Beijing 100048, China.

37291675	The arterial occlusive disease is one of the leading causes of cardiovascular diseases, often requiring revascularization. Lack of suitable small-diameter vascular grafts (SDVGs), infection, thrombosis, and intimal hyperplasia associated with synthetic vascular grafts lead to a low success rate of SDVGs (< 6 mm) transplantation in the clinical treatment of cardiovascular diseases. The development of fabrication technology along with vascular tissue engineering and regenerative medicine technology allows biological tissue-engineered vascular grafts to become living grafts, which can integrate, remodel, and repair the host vessels as well as respond to the surrounding mechanical and biochemical stimuli. Hence, they potentially alleviate the shortage of existing vascular grafts. This paper evaluates the current advanced fabrication technologies for SDVGs, including electrospinning, molding, 3D printing, decellularization, and so on. Various characteristics of synthetic polymers and surface modification methods are also introduced. In addition, it also provides interdisciplinary insights into the future of small-diameter prostheses and discusses vital factors and perspectives for developing such prostheses in clinical applications. We propose that the performance of SDVGs can be improved by integrating various technologies in the near future.

37277439	The preparation of controllable micro/nano structures on the surface of the bredigite scaffold is expected to exhibit the same support and osteoconductive capabilities as living bone. However, the hydrophobicity of the white calciμm silicate scaffold surface restricts the adhesion and spreading of osteoblasts. Furthermore, during the degradation process of the bredigite scaffold, the release of Ca2+ results in an alkaline environment around the scaffold, which inhibits the growth of osteoblasts. In this study, the three-dimensional geometry of the Primitive surface in the three-periodic minimal surface with an average curvature of 0 was used as the basis for the scaffold unit cell, and a white hydroxyapatite scaffold was fabricated via photopolymerization-based 3D printing. Nanoparticles, microparticles, and micro-sheet structures with thicknesses of 6 μm, 24 μm, and 42 μm, respectively, were prepared on the surface of the porous scaffold through a hydrothermal reaction. The results of the study indicate that the micro/nano surface did not affect the morphology and mineralization ability of the macroporous scaffold. However, the transition from hydrophobic to hydrophilic resulted in a rougher surface and an increase in compressive strength from 45 to 59-86 MPa, while the adhesion of the micro/nano structures enhanced the scaffold's ductility. In addition, after 8 days of degradation, the pH of the degradation solution decreased from 8.6 to around 7.6, which is more suitable for cell growth in the hμman body. However, there were issues of slow degradation and high P element concentration in the degradation solution for the microscale layer group during the degradation process, so the nanoparticle and microparticle group scaffolds could provide effective support and a suitable environment for bone tissue repair.

37269532	In living tissues, cells express their functions following complex signals from their surrounding microenvironment. Capturing both hierarchical architectures at the micro- and macroscale, and anisotropic cell patterning remains a major challenge in bioprinting, and a bottleneck toward creating physiologically-relevant models. Addressing this limitation, a novel technique is introduced, termed Embedded Extrusion-Volumetric Printing (EmVP), converging extrusion-bioprinting and layer-less, ultra-fast volumetric bioprinting, allowing spatially pattern multiple inks/cell types. Light-responsive microgels are developed for the first time as bioresins (µResins) for light-based volumetric bioprinting, providing a microporous environment permissive for cell homing and self-organization. Tuning the mechanical and optical properties of gelatin-based microparticles enables their use as support bath for suspended extrusion printing, in which features containing high cell densities can be easily introduced. µResins can be sculpted within seconds with tomographic light projections into centimeter-scale, granular hydrogel-based, convoluted constructs. Interstitial microvoids enhanced differentiation of multiple stem/progenitor cells (vascular, mesenchymal, neural), otherwise not possible with conventional bulk hydrogels. As proof-of-concept, EmVP is applied to create complex synthetic biology-inspired intercellular communication models, where adipocyte differentiation is regulated by optogenetic-engineered pancreatic cells. Overall, EmVP offers new avenues for producing regenerative grafts with biological functionality, and for developing engineered living systems and (metabolic) disease models.

37264745	In vitro neurovascular unit (NVU) models are valuable for investigating brain functions and developing drugs. However, it remains challenging to recapitulate the native architectural features and ultra-soft extracellular matrix (ECM) properties of the natural NVU. Cell-laden bioprinting is promising to prepare complex living tissues, but hard to balance the fidelity and cell growth. This study proposes a novel two-stage methodology for biomanufacturing functional 3D neurovascular constructs in vitro with low modulus of ECM. At the shaping stage, a low-viscosity alginate/collagen is printed through an embedded approach; at the culturing stage, the alginate is removed through targeted lysing. The low-viscosity and rapid crosslinking properties provide a printing resolution of ≈10 µm, and the lysis processing can decrease the hydrogels' modulus to ≈1 kPa and adjust the porosity of the microstructure, providing cells with an environment closing to the brain ECM. A 3D hollow coaxial neurovascular model is fabricated, in which the endothelial cells has expressed tight junction proteins and shown selective permeability, and the astrocytes outside of the endothelial layer are found to spread out with branches and directly interact with endothelial cells. The present study offers a promising modeling method for better understanding the NVU function and screening neuro-drugs.	3D Bioprinting of Neurovascular Tissue Modeling with Collagen-Based Low-Viscosity Composites.	2023	Oct	Wang Sen;Bai Luge;Hu Xiaoxuan;Yao Siqi;Hao Zhiyan;Zhou Jiajia;Li Xiao;Lu Haixia;He Jiankang;Wang Ling;Li Dichen	3D bioprinting;embedded printing;extracellular matrix;in vitro neural tissue;vascular-like structures	Endothelial Cells;Bioprinting;Viscosity;Hydrogels;Collagen;Alginates;Printing, Three-Dimensional;Tissue Scaffolds;Tissue Engineering	Advanced healthcare materials	State Key Laboratory for Manufacturing System Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, 710054, China.;School of Mechanical Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, 710054, China.;NMPA Key Laboratory for Research and Evaluation of Additive Manufacturing Medical Devices, Xi'an, 710054, China.;State Key Laboratory for Manufacturing System Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, 710054, China.;School of Mechanical Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, 710054, China.;NMPA Key Laboratory for Research and Evaluation of Additive Manufacturing Medical Devices, Xi'an, 710054, China.;Institute of Neurobiology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Xi'an Jiaotong University Health Science Center, Xi'an, 710061, China.;Key Laboratory of Ministry of Education for Environment and Genes Related to Diseases, Xi'an Jiaotong University Health Science Center, Xi'an, 710061, China.;State Key Laboratory for Manufacturing System Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, 710054, China.;School of Mechanical Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, 710054, China.;NMPA Key Laboratory for Research and Evaluation of Additive Manufacturing Medical Devices, Xi'an, 710054, China.;State Key Laboratory for Manufacturing System Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, 710054, China.;School of Mechanical Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, 710054, China.;NMPA Key Laboratory for Research and Evaluation of Additive Manufacturing Medical Devices, Xi'an, 710054, China.;State Key Laboratory for Manufacturing System Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, 710054, China.;School of Mechanical Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, 710054, China.;NMPA Key Laboratory for Research and Evaluation of Additive Manufacturing Medical Devices, Xi'an, 710054, China.;State Key Laboratory for Manufacturing System Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, 710054, China.;School of Mechanical Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, 710054, China.;NMPA Key Laboratory for Research and Evaluation of Additive Manufacturing Medical Devices, Xi'an, 710054, China.;Institute of Neurobiology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Xi'an Jiaotong University Health Science Center, Xi'an, 710061, China.;Key Laboratory of Ministry of Education for Environment and Genes Related to Diseases, Xi'an Jiaotong University Health Science Center, Xi'an, 710061, China.;Department of Human Anatomy & Histoembryology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Xi'an Jiaotong University Health Science Center, Xi'an, 710061, China.;State Key Laboratory for Manufacturing System Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, 710054, China.;School of Mechanical Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, 710054, China.;NMPA Key Laboratory for Research and Evaluation of Additive Manufacturing Medical Devices, Xi'an, 710054, China.;State Key Laboratory for Manufacturing System Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, 710054, China.;School of Mechanical Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, 710054, China.;NMPA Key Laboratory for Research and Evaluation of Additive Manufacturing Medical Devices, Xi'an, 710054, China.;State Key Laboratory for Manufacturing System Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, 710054, China.;School of Mechanical Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, 710054, China.;NMPA Key Laboratory for Research and Evaluation of Additive Manufacturing Medical Devices, Xi'an, 710054, China.		an Jiaotong University, Xi, China;Histoembryology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, China;an Jiaotong University Health Science Center, Xi, China;State Key Laboratory for Manufacturing System Engineering, Xi, China;NMPA Key Laboratory for Research and Evaluation of Additive Manufacturing Medical Devices, Xi, China;an, , China;Key Laboratory of Ministry of Education for Environment and Genes Related to Diseases, Xi, China;Institute of Neurobiology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, China;School of Mechanical Engineering, Xi, China	
37242919	In this brief review, we discuss the recent advancements in using poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA) hydrogels for tissue engineering applications. PEGDA hydrogels are highly attractive in biomedical and biotechnology fields due to their soft and hydrated properties that can replicate living tissues. These hydrogels can be manipulated using light, heat, and cross-linkers to achieve desirable functionalities. Unlike previous reviews that focused solely on material design and fabrication of bioactive hydrogels and their cell viability and interactions with the extracellular matrix (ECM), we compare the traditional bulk photo-crosslinking method with the latest three-dimensional (3D) printing of PEGDA hydrogels. We present detailed evidence combining the physical, chemical, bulk, and localized mechanical characteristics, including their composition, fabrication methods, experimental conditions, and reported mechanical properties of bulk and 3D printed PEGDA hydrogels. Furthermore, we highlight the current state of biomedical applications of 3D PEGDA hydrogels in tissue engineering and organ-on-chip devices over the last 20 years. Finally, we delve into the current obstacles and future possibilities in the field of engineering 3D layer-by-layer (LbL) PEGDA hydrogels for tissue engineering and organ-on-chip devices.

37236174	Biofilm-associated infections are causing over half a million deaths each year, raising the requirement for innovative therapeutic approaches. For developing novel therapeutics against bacterial biofilm infections, complexin vitromodels that allow to study drug effects on both pathogens and host cells as well as their interaction under controlled, physiologically relevant conditions appear as highly desirable. Nonetheless, building such models is quite challenging because (1) rapid bacterial growth and release of virulence factors may lead to premature host cell death and (2) maintaining the biofilm status under suitable co-culture requires a highly controlled environment. To approach that problem, we chose 3D bioprinting. However, printing living bacterial biofilms in defined shapes on human cell models, requires bioinks with very specific properties. Hence, this work aims to develop a 3D bioprinting biofilm method to build robustin vitroinfection models. Based on rheology, printability and bacterial growth, a bioink containing 3% gelatin and 1% alginate in Luria-Bertani-medium was found optimal forEscherichia coliMG1655 biofilms. Biofilm properties were maintained after printing, as shown visually via microscopy techniques as well as in antibiotic susceptibility assays. Metabolic profile analysis of bioprinted biofilms showed high similarity to native biofilms. After printing on human bronchial epithelial cells (Calu-3), the shape of printed biofilms was maintained even after dissolution of non-crosslinked bioink, while no cytotoxicity was observed over 24 h. Therefore, the approach presented here may provide a platform for building complexin vitroinfection models comprising bacterial biofilms and human host cells.	3D bioprinting ofE. coliMG1655 biofilms on human lung epithelial cells for building complexin vitroinfection models.	2023	Jun	Aliyazdi Samy;Frisch Sarah;Hidalgo Alberto;Frank Nicolas;Krug Daniel;Müller Rolf;Schaefer Ulrich F;Vogt Thomas;Loretz Brigitta;Lehr Claus-Michael	3D printing;alternatives to animal experiments;antimicrobial resistance;chronic lung infections;hydrogel	Humans;Bioprinting;Printing, Three-Dimensional;Hydrogels;Biofilms;Bacteria;Epithelial Cells;Tissue Scaffolds;Tissue Engineering	Biofabrication	Department of Drug Delivery, Helmholtz Center for Infection Research, Helmholtz-Institute for Pharmaceutical Research Saarland, Campus E8 1, 66123 Saarbrücken, Germany.;Saarland University, 66123 Saarbrücken, Germany.;Department of Drug Delivery, Helmholtz Center for Infection Research, Helmholtz-Institute for Pharmaceutical Research Saarland, Campus E8 1, 66123 Saarbrücken, Germany.;Saarland University, 66123 Saarbrücken, Germany.;Department of Drug Delivery, Helmholtz Center for Infection Research, Helmholtz-Institute for Pharmaceutical Research Saarland, Campus E8 1, 66123 Saarbrücken, Germany.;Charite-Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Institute of Functional Anatomy, Philippstraße 12, 10115 Berlin, Germany.;Department of Microbial Natural Products, Helmholtz Center for Infection Research, Helmholtz-Institute for Pharmaceutical Research Saarland, Campus E8 1, 66123 Saarbrücken, Germany.;Department of Microbial Natural Products, Helmholtz Center for Infection Research, Helmholtz-Institute for Pharmaceutical Research Saarland, Campus E8 1, 66123 Saarbrücken, Germany.;Saarland University, 66123 Saarbrücken, Germany.;Department of Microbial Natural Products, Helmholtz Center for Infection Research, Helmholtz-Institute for Pharmaceutical Research Saarland, Campus E8 1, 66123 Saarbrücken, Germany.;Saarland University, 66123 Saarbrücken, Germany.;Saarland University, 66123 Saarbrücken, Germany.;University Clinic Homburg, Clinic for Dermatology, Kirrberger Str., 66424 Homburg, Germany.;Department of Drug Delivery, Helmholtz Center for Infection Research, Helmholtz-Institute for Pharmaceutical Research Saarland, Campus E8 1, 66123 Saarbrücken, Germany.;Saarland University, 66123 Saarbrücken, Germany.;Department of Drug Delivery, Helmholtz Center for Infection Research, Helmholtz-Institute for Pharmaceutical Research Saarland, Campus E8 1, 66123 Saarbrücken, Germany.;Saarland University, 66123 Saarbrücken, Germany.

37188103	Three-dimensional bioprinting utilizes additive manufacturing processes that combine cells and a bioink to create living tissue models that mimic tissues found in vivo. Stem cells can regenerate and differentiate into specialized cell types, making them valuable for research concerning degenerative diseases and their potential treatments. 3D bioprinting stem cell-derived tissues have an advantage over other cell types because they can be expanded in large quantities and then differentiated to multiple cell types. Using patient-derived stem cells also enables a personalized medicine approach to the study of disease progression. In particular, mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) are an attractive cell type for bioprinting because they are easier to obtain from patients in comparison to pluripotent stem cells, and their robust characteristics make them desirable for bioprinting. Currently, both MSC bioprinting protocols and cell culturing protocols exist separately, but there is a lack of literature that combines the culturing of the cells with the bioprinting process. This protocol aims to bridge that gap by describing the bioprinting process in detail, starting with how to culture cells pre-printing, to 3D bioprinting the cells, and finally to the culturing process post-printing. Here, we outline the process of culturing MSCs to produce cells for 3D bioprinting. We also describe the process of preparing Axolotl Biosciences TissuePrint - High Viscosity (HV) and Low Viscosity (LV) bioink, the incorporation of MSCs to the bioink, setting up the BIO X and the Aspect RX1 bioprinters, and necessary computer-aided design (CAD) files. We also detail the differentiation of 2D and 3D cell cultures of MSC to dopaminergic neurons, including media preparation. We have also included the protocols for viability, immunocytochemistry, electrophysiology, and performing a dopamine enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), along with the statistical analysis.

37182936	While the natural carbohydrate alginate has enabled effective three-dimensional (3D) extrusion bioprinting, it still suffers from some issues such as low printability and resolution and limited cellular function due to ionic crosslinking dependency. Here, we prepared a harmless visible light-based photocrosslinkable alginate by chemically bonding tyrosine-like residues onto alginate chains to propose a new microgel manufacturing system for the development of 3D-printed bioinks. The photocrosslinkable tyramine-conjugated alginate microgel achieved both higher cell viability and printing resolution compared to the bulk gel form. This alginate-based jammed granular microgel bioink showed excellent 3D bioprinting ability with maintained structural stability. As a biocompatible material, the developed multiple cell-loaded photocrosslinkable alginate-based microgel bioink provided excellent proliferation and migration abilities of laden living cells, providing an effective strategy to construct implantable functional artificial organ structures for 3D bioprinting-based tissue engineering.

37168003	Bio-based hydrogels as three-dimensional (3D) constructs have attracted attention in advanced tissue engineering. Compared with conventional two-dimensional (2D) cell culture, cells grown in 3D scaffolds are expected to demonstrate the inherent behavior of living organisms of cellular spheroids. Herein, we constructed cell-laden nanofiber-based hydrogels in combination with 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine 1-oxyl-oxidized cellulose nanofiber (TOCNF) and chitosan nanofiber (CsNF) for bioadaptive liver tissue engineering. The carboxylates of TOCNF and amines of CsNF were directly crosslinked via EDC/NHS chemistry. The rheological properties of the solutions for the nanofibers and hydrogels revealed sufficient physical properties for the injection, printing, and plotting process, as well as significant encapsulation of living cells. As-designed hydrogels exhibited excellent viscoelastic properties with typical shear-thinning behavior, and had a storage modulus of 1234 Pa ± 68 Pa, suitable for cell culture. Non-cytotoxicity was confirmed using a live/dead assay with mouse-derived fibroblast NIH/3T3 cells. Human hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells could be cultured on a gel surface (2D environment) and encapsulated in the gel structure (3D environment), which enabled 10 d growth with high gene expression level of albumin of HepG2 spheroids in the 3D gels. The biodegradable cell-laden hydrogels are expected to mimic the cellular microenvironment and provide potential for bioadaptive 3D cell cultures in biomedical applications.

37155968	Bioprinting as an extension of 3D printing offers capabilities for printing tissues and organs for application in biomedical engineering. Conducting bioprinting in space, where the gravity is zero, can enable new frontiers in tissue engineering. Fabrication of soft tissues, which usually collapse under their own weight, can be accelerated in microgravity conditions as the external forces are eliminated. Furthermore, human colonization in space can be supported by providing critical needs of life and ecosystems by 3D bioprinting without relying on cargos from Earth, e.g., by development and long-term employment of living engineered filters (such as sea sponges-known as critical for initiating and maintaining an ecosystem). This review covers bioprinting methods in microgravity along with providing an analysis on the process of shipping bioprinters to space and presenting a perspective on the prospects of zero-gravity bioprinting.

37123528	Extrusion-based (fused filament fabrication) three-dimensional (3D) printing of shape-memory polymers (SMPs) has the potential to rapidly produce highly customized smart-material parts. Yet, the effects of printing parameters on the shape-memory properties of printed SMPs remain poorly understood. To study the extent to which the 3D printing process affects the shape-memory properties of a printed SMP part, here temperature, extrusion rate multiplier, and fiber orientation were systematically varied, and their effect on shape-memory fixing and recovery ratios was evaluated. Fiber orientation, as determined by print path relative to the direction(s) of loading during shape-memory programming, was found to significantly impact the fixing ratio and the recovery ratio. Temperature and multiplier had little effect on either fixing ratio or recovery ratio. To facilitate the use of printed SMP parts in biomedical applications, a cell viability assay was performed on 3D-printed samples prepared using varied temperature and multiplier. Reduction in multiplier was found to increase cell viability. The results indicate that fiber orientation can critically impact the shape-memory functionality of 3D-printed SMP parts, and that multiplier can affect cytocompatibility of those parts. Thus, researchers and manufacturers employing SMPs in 3D-printed parts and devices could achieve improved part functionality if print paths are designed to align fiber direction with the axis(es) in which strain will be programmed and recovered and if the multiplier is optimized in biomedical applications in which a part will contact cells.

37123517	The injection molding process is only economical with large batch sizes due to expensive tools that cannot be used variably. Additively manufactured tools made of plastic could reduce manufacturing costs and represent an alternative to conventionally manufactured tools for prototype applications as well as enabling small series with the injection molding process. The aim of this article was to examine additively manufactured injection molding tools; to determine their potential in terms of service life, surface quality, and production time; and to link them with the production costs so that the profitability can be assessed. Therefore, a reference component and an injection mold have been designed. To test the capabilities of different 3D printing techniques and materials, three molds have been produced by fused filament fabrication (FFF), one by PolyJet process, one by digital light processing, and for a direct comparison to conventional methods, one mold has been milled from aluminum. All molds have been tested in two series. First, they were used under the same conditions over a period of 100 injection molding cycles. Based on the knowledge obtained and an additional profitability analysis, three forms could be identified as promising. Two of these forms could be further investigated in a second series of tests. Based on all experiments, the technical feasibility of additively manufactured injection molds for small batch production could be confirmed. It could be evaluated that each manufacturing process and every material has some advantages and disadvantages. On the one hand, temperature-resistant thermoplastics can be processed with FFF, which can withstand service lives of more than 150 cycles without any signs of wear and are therefore suitable for small series. On the other hand, the PolyJet process achieves good surface qualities and short production times, which means that it can be used for prototype applications.

37121370	A three-dimensional (3D) artificial skin model offers diverse platforms for skin transplantation, disease mechanisms, and biomaterial testing for skin tissue. However, implementing physiological complexes such as the neurovascular system with living cells in this stratified structure is extremely difficult. In this study, full-thickness skin models were fabricated from methacrylated silk fibroin (Silk-GMA) and gelatin (Gel-GMA) seeded with keratinocytes, fibroblasts, and vascular endothelial cells representing the epidermis and dermis layers through a digital light processing (DLP) 3D printer. Printability, mechanical properties, and cell viability of the skin hydrogels fabricated with different concentrations of Silk-GMA and Gel-GMA were analyzed to find the optimal concentrations for the 3D printing of the artificial skin model. After the skin model was DLP-3D printed using Gel-GMA 15% + Silk-GMA 5% bioink, cultured, and air-lifted for four weeks, well-proliferated keratinocytes and fibroblasts were observed in histological analysis, and increased expressions of Cytokeratin 13, Phalloidin, and CD31 were noted in immunofluorescence staining. Furthermore, full-thickness skin wound models were 3D-printed to evaluate the wound-healing capabilities of the skin hydrogel. When the epidermal growth factor (EGF) was applied, enhanced wound healing in the epidermis and dermis layer with the proliferation of keratinocytes and fibroblasts was observed. Also, the semi-quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction revealed increased expression of Cytokeratin 13, fibroblast growth factor, and CD31 in the EGF-treated group relative to the control group. The DLP 3D-printed artificial skin model was mechanically stable and biocompatible for more than four weeks, demonstrating the potential for application in skin tissue engineering. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: A full-thickness artificial skin model was 3D-printed in this study with a digital light processing technique using silk fibroin and gelatin, which mimics the structural and cellular compositions of the human skin. The 3D-printed skin hydrogel ensured the viability of the cells in the skin layers that proliferated well after air-lifting cultivation, shown in the histological analysis and immunofluorescence stainings. Furthermore, full-thickness skin wound models were 3D-printed to evaluate the wound healing capabilities of the skin hydrogel, which demonstrated enhanced wound healing in the epidermis and dermis layer with the application of epidermal growth factor on the wound compared to the control. The bioengineered hydrogel expands the applicability of artificial skin models for skin substitutes, wound models, and drug testing.

37109400	Non-invasive visualization and monitoring of tissue-engineered structures in a living organism is a challenge. One possible solution to this problem is to use upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) as photoluminescent nanomarkers in scaffolds. We synthesized and studied scaffolds based on natural (collagen-COL and hyaluronic acid-HA) and synthetic (polylactic-co-glycolic acids-PLGA) polymers loaded with β-NaYF4:Yb3+, Er3+ nanocrystals (21 ± 6 nm). Histomorphological analysis of tissue response to subcutaneous implantation of the polymer scaffolds in BALB/c mice was performed. The inflammatory response of the surrounding tissues was found to be weak for scaffolds based on HA and PLGA and moderate for COL scaffolds. An epi-luminescent imaging system with 975 nm laser excitation was used for in vivo visualization and photoluminescent analysis of implanted scaffolds. We demonstrated that the UCNPs' photoluminescent signal monotonously decreased in all the examined scaffolds, indicating their gradual biodegradation followed by the release of photoluminescent nanoparticles into the surrounding tissues. In general, the data obtained from the photoluminescent analysis correlated satisfactorily with the histomorphological analysis.

37099802	Major challenges in biofabrication revolve around capturing the complex, hierarchical composition of native tissues. However, individual 3D printing techniques have limited capacity to produce composite biomaterials with multi-scale resolution. Volumetric bioprinting recently emerged as a paradigm-shift in biofabrication. This ultrafast, light-based technique sculpts cell-laden hydrogel bioresins into 3D structures in a layerless fashion, providing enhanced design freedom over conventional bioprinting. However, it yields prints with low mechanical stability, since soft, cell-friendly hydrogels are used. Herein, the possibility to converge volumetric bioprinting with melt electrowriting, which excels at patterning microfibers, is shown for the fabrication of tubular hydrogel-based composites with enhanced mechanical behavior. Despite including non-transparent melt electrowritten scaffolds in the volumetric printing process, high-resolution bioprinted structures are successfully achieved. Tensile, burst, and bending mechanical properties of printed tubes are tuned altering the electrowritten mesh design, resulting in complex, multi-material tubular constructs with customizable, anisotropic geometries that better mimic intricate biological tubular structures. As a proof-of-concept, engineered tubular structures are obtained by building trilayered cell-laden vessels, and features (valves, branches, fenestrations) that can be rapidly printed using this hybrid approach. This multi-technology convergence offers a new toolbox for manufacturing hierarchical and mechanically tunable multi-material living structures.

37081861	Tissue engineering strategy that combine biomaterials with living cells has shown special advantages in tissue regeneration and promoted the development of regenerative medicine. In particular, the rising of 3D printing technology further enriched the structural design and composition of tissue engineering scaffolds, which also provided convenience for cell loading and cell delivery of living cells. In this review, two types of cell-delivery scaffolds for tissue regeneration, including 3D printed scaffolds with subsequent cell-seeding and 3D cells bioprinted scaffolds, are mainly reviewed. We devote a major part to present and discuss the recent advances of two 3D printed cell-delivery scaffolds in regeneration of various tissues, involving bone, cartilage, skin tissues etc. Although two types of 3D printed cell-delivery scaffolds have some shortcomings, they do have generally facilitated the exploration of tissue engineering scaffolds in multiple tissue regeneration. It is expected that 3D printed cell-delivery scaffolds will be further explored in function mechanism of seeding cells in vivo, precise mimicking of complex tissues and even organ reconstruction under the cooperation of multiple fields in future.	3D printing of cell-delivery scaffolds for tissue regeneration.	2023		Xue Jianmin;Qin Chen;Wu Chengtie	3D printing;cell-delivery;tissue regeneration		Regenerative biomaterials	State Key Laboratory of High Performance Ceramics and Superfine Microstructure, Shanghai Institute of Ceramics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 200050, People's Republic of China.;State Key Laboratory of High Performance Ceramics and Superfine Microstructure, Shanghai Institute of Ceramics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 200050, People's Republic of China.;State Key Laboratory of High Performance Ceramics and Superfine Microstructure, Shanghai Institute of Ceramics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 200050, People's Republic of China.;Center of Materials Science and Optoelectronics Engineering, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, People's Republic of China.

37077229	Living building materials (LBM) are gaining interest in the field of sustainable alternative construction materials to reduce the significant impact of the construction industry on global CO2 emissions. This study investigated the process of three-dimensional bioprinting to create LBM incorporating the cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. strain PCC 7002, which is capable of producing calcium carbonate (CaCO3) as a biocement. Rheology and printability of biomaterial inks based on alginate-methylcellulose hydrogels containing up to 50 wt% sea sand were examined. PCC 7002 was incorporated into the bioinks and cell viability and growth was characterized by fluorescence microscopy and chlorophyll extraction after the printing process. Biomineralization was induced in liquid culture and in the bioprinted LBM and observed by scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and through mechanical characterization. Cell viability in the bioprinted scaffolds was confirmed over 14 days of cultivation, demonstrating that the cells were able to withstand shear stress and pressure during the extrusion process and remain viable in the immobilized state. CaCO3 mineralization of PCC 7002 was observed in both liquid culture and bioprinted LBM. In comparison to cell-free scaffolds, LBM containing live cyanobacteria had a higher compressive strength. Therefore, bioprinted LBM containing photosynthetically active, mineralizing microorganisms could be proved to be beneficial for designing environmentally friendly construction materials.	3D bioprinting of mineralizing cyanobacteria as novel approach for the fabrication of living building materials.	2023		Reinhardt Olena;Ihmann Stephanie;Ahlhelm Matthias;Gelinsky Michael	MICP;Synechococcus sp;biocement;biomineralization;engineered living materials;living building materials;microbially induced carbonate precipitation;three-dimensional printing		Frontiers in bioengineering and biotechnology	Centre for Translational Bone, Joint and Soft Tissue Research, Faculty of Medicine Carl Gustav Carus, Technische Universität Dresden, Dresden, Germany.;Biologized Materials and Structures, Fraunhofer Institute for Ceramic Technologies and Systems IKTS, Dresden, Germany.;Biologized Materials and Structures, Fraunhofer Institute for Ceramic Technologies and Systems IKTS, Dresden, Germany.;Centre for Translational Bone, Joint and Soft Tissue Research, Faculty of Medicine Carl Gustav Carus, Technische Universität Dresden, Dresden, Germany.

37069779	"In the extant lifeforms, the self-sustaining behaviors refer to various well-organized biochemical reactions in spatial confinement, which rely on compartmentalization to integrate and coordinate the molecularly crowded intracellular environment and complicated reaction networks in living/synthetic cells. Therefore, the biological phenomenon of compartmentalization has become an essential theme in the field of synthetic cell engineering. Recent progress in the state-of-the-art of synthetic cells has indicated that multi-compartmentalized synthetic cells should be developed to obtain more advanced structures and functions. Herein, two ways of developing multi-compartmentalized hierarchical systems, namely interior compartmentalization of synthetic cells (organelles) and integration of synthetic cell communities (synthetic tissues), are summarized. Examples are provided for different construction strategies employed in the above-mentioned engineering ways, including spontaneous compartmentalization in vesicles, host-guest nesting, phase separation mediated multiphase, adhesion-mediated assembly, programmed arrays, and 3D printing. Apart from exhibiting advanced structures and functions, synthetic cells are also applied as biomimetic materials. Finally, key challenges and future directions regarding the development of multi-compartmentalized hierarchical systems are summarized; these are expected to lay the foundation for the creation of a ""living"" synthetic cell as well as provide a larger platform for developing new biomimetic materials in the future."

37057655	"Three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting is evolving into a promising technology by spatially controlling the distribution of living cells for the biomedical field. However, maintaining high printability while protecting cells from damage due to shear stress remains the key challenge for extrusion-based 3D bioprinting. Herein, we developed a novel ""protein-polyphenol-polysaccharide"" extrusion-based bioink named Gel-TA-Alg@Ca2+ using gelatin (Gel), tannic acid (TA) and sodium alginate (Alg) with quantitative thixotropy by pre-crosslinking with a series of low concentrations of CaCl2 at 0.03, 0.04, 0.05 and 0.06 M, respectively. Our experimental design quantitatively presented the positive proportional functional relationship between the thixotropy of Gel-TA-Alg@Ca2+ and printability (including injectability and formability) for the first time. Importantly, the thixotropy proportionately and significantly elevated cellular viability after 3D bioprinting due to the reduced extrusion force involved in printing. 3D bioprinted constructs composed of Gel-TA-Alg@Ca2+ and MG-63 cells exhibited a good cell viability rate for more than 14 days. These findings provide valuable insights into the rational design of thixotropic bioink and offer more opportunities to probe the relationship between the thixotropy and the success of 3D bioprinting."

37020512	Tissue defects can lead to serious health problems and often require grafts or transplants to repair damaged soft tissues. However, these procedures can be complex and may not always be feasible due to a lack of available tissue. Hydrogels have shown potential as a replacement for tissue grafts due to their ability to support cell survival and encapsulate biomolecules such as growth factors. In particular, guanosine-based hydrogels have been explored as a potential solution, but they often exhibit limited stability which hampers their use in the biofabrication of complex grafts. To address this issue, we explored the use of borate ester chemistry and more complex boric acid derivatives to improve the stability and properties of guanosine-based hydrogels. We hypothesized that the aromatic rings in these derivatives would enhance the stability and printability of the hydrogels through added π-π stack interactions. After optimization, 13 compositions containing either 2-naphthylboronic acid or boric acid were selected. Morphology studies shows a well-defined nanofibrilar structure with good printable properties (thixotropic behaviour, print fidelity and printability). Moreover, the pH of all tested hydrogels was within the range suitable for cell viability (7.4-8.3). Nevertheless, only the boric acid-based formulations were stable for at least 7 days. Thus, our results clearly demonstrated that the presence of additional aromatic rings did actually impair the hydrogel properties. We speculate that this is due to steric hindrance caused by adjacent groups, which disrupt the correct orientation of the aromatic groups required for effective π-π stack interactions of the guanosine building block. Despite this drawback, the developed guanosine-boric acid hydrogel exhibited good thixotropic properties and was able to support cell survival, proliferation, and migration. For instance, SaOS-2 cells planted on these printed structures readily migrated into the hydrogel and showed nearly 100% cell viability after 7 days. In conclusion, our findings highlight the potential of guanosine-boric acid hydrogels as tissue engineering scaffolds that can be readily enhanced with living cells and bioactive molecules. Thus, our work represents a significant advancement towards the development of functionalized guanosine-based hydrogels.

37019216	Cancer treatment development is a complex process, with tumor heterogeneity and inter-patient variations limiting the success of therapeutic intervention. Traditional two-dimensional cell culture has been used to study cancer metabolism, but it fails to capture physiologically relevant cell-cell and cell-environment interactions required to mimic tumor-specific architecture. Over the past three decades, research efforts in the field of 3D cancer model fabrication using tissue engineering have addressed this unmet need. The self-organized and scaffold-based model has shown potential to study the cancer microenvironment and eventually bridge the gap between 2D cell culture and animal models. Recently, three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting has emerged as an exciting and novel biofabrication strategy aimed at developing a 3D compartmentalized hierarchical organization with the precise positioning of biomolecules, including living cells. In this review, we discuss the advancements in 3D culture techniques for the fabrication of cancer models, as well as their benefits and limitations.

37019198	Wound healing is a complex project, and effectively promoting skin repair is a huge clinical challenge. Hydrogels have great prospect in the field of wound dressings because their physical properties are very similar to those of living tissue and have excellent properties such as high water content, oxygen permeability and softness. However, the single performance of traditional hydrogels limits their application as wound dressings. Therefore, natural polymers such as chitosan, alginate and hyaluronic acid, which are non-toxic and biocompatible, are individually or combined with other polymer materials, and loaded with typical drugs, bioactive molecules or nanomaterials. Then, the development of novel multifunctional hydrogel dressings with good antibacterial, self-healing, injectable and multi-stimulation responsiveness by using advanced technologies such as 3D printing, electrospinning and stem cell therapy has become a hot topic of current research. This paper focuses on the functional properties of novel multifunctional hydrogel dressings such as chitosan, alginate and hyaluronic acid, which lays the foundation for the research of novel hydrogel dressings with better performance.

37000873	Three-dimensional bioprinting has emerged as a promising tool for spatially patterning cells to fabricate models of human tissue. Here, we present an engineered bioink material designed to have viscoelastic mechanical behavior, similar to that of living tissue. This viscoelastic bioink is cross-linked through dynamic covalent bonds, a reversible bond type that allows for cellular remodeling over time. Viscoelastic materials are challenging to use as inks, as one must tune the kinetics of the dynamic cross-links to allow for both extrudability and long-term stability. We overcome this challenge through the use of small molecule catalysts and competitors that temporarily modulate the cross-linking kinetics and degree of network formation. These inks were then used to print a model of breast cancer cell invasion, where the inclusion of dynamic cross-links was found to be required for the formation of invasive protrusions. Together, we demonstrate the power of engineered, dynamic bioinks to recapitulate the native cellular microenvironment for disease modeling.	3D bioprinting of dynamic hydrogel bioinks enabled by small molecule modulators.	2023	Mar	Hull Sarah M;Lou Junzhe;Lindsay Christopher D;Navarro Renato S;Cai Betty;Brunel Lucia G;Westerfield Ashley D;Xia Yan;Heilshorn Sarah C		Humans;Tissue Scaffolds;Hydrogels;Tissue Engineering;Bioprinting;Printing, Three-Dimensional	Science advances	Department of Chemical Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.;Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.;Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.;Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.;Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.;Department of Chemical Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.;Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.;Department of Chemistry, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.;Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.

Over the past few decades, considerable scientific research has made breakthroughs in a variety of applications such as pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, agriculture, biosensors, bioseparation, defense, and cosmetics. In the present review, different classifications of hydrogels and their limitations have been discussed. In addition, techniques involved in improving the physical, mechanical, and biological properties of hydrogels by admixing various organic and inorganic materials are explored. Future 3D printing technology will substantially advance the ability to pattern molecules, cells, and organs.

36926305	Two-photon polymerization (TPP)-based 3D printing technology utilizes the two-photon absorption process of near-infrared radiation, enabling the fabrication of micro- and nano-scale three-dimensional structures with extremely high resolution. It has been widely applied in scientific fields closely related to living organisms, such as tissue engineering, drug delivery, and biosensors. Nevertheless, the existing photoresist materials have poor mechanical tunability and are hardly able to be doped with functional materials, resulting in constraints on the preparation of functional devices with micro-nano structures. In this paper, TPP printable polymer formulas with good mechanical tunability, high resolution, strong functional scalability, and excellent biocompatibility are proposed, by using the synergistic effects of a hydroxyl group-containing photocurable resin prepolymer, UV acrylate monomer, long-chain hydrophilic crosslinking monomer and photo-initiator. This can ensure the printability and help to improve the flexibility of the printed polymer, thereby solving the problem the photosensitive materials suitable for two-photon 3D printing in previous research had in balancing the formability and flexibility. The results of nanoindenter analysis showed that the Young's modulus of the printed structure can be adjusted between 0.3 GPa and 1.43 GPa, realizing mechanical tunability. Also, complex structures, such as micro-scaffold structures and high aspect ratio hollow microneedles were printed to explore the structural stability as well as the feasibility of biodevice application.

36911914	Engineered, centimeter-scale skeletal muscle tissue (SMT) can mimic muscle pathophysiology to study development, disease, regeneration, drug response, and motion. Macroscale SMT requires perfusable channels to guarantee cell survival, and support elements to enable mechanical cell stimulation and uniaxial myofiber formation. Here, stable biohybrid designs of centimeter-scale SMT are realized via extrusion-based bioprinting of an optimized polymeric blend based on gelatin methacryloyl and sodium alginate, which can be accurately coprinted with other inks. A perfusable microchannel network is designed to functionally integrate with perfusable anchors for insertion into a maturation culture template. The results demonstrate that i) coprinted synthetic structures display highly coherent interfaces with the living tissue, ii) perfusable designs preserve cells from hypoxia all over the scaffold volume, iii) constructs can undergo passive mechanical tension during matrix remodeling, and iv) the constructs can be used to study the distribution of drugs. Extrusion-based multimaterial bioprinting with the inks and design realizes in vitro matured biohybrid SMT for biomedical applications.

36878526	Objective: To explore the effects of three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting gelatin methacrylamide (GelMA) hydrogel loaded with nano silver on full-thickness skin defect wounds in rats. Methods: The experimental research method was adopted. The morphology, particle diameter, and distribution of silver nanoparticles in nano silver solution with different mass concentrations and the pore structure of silver-containing GelMA hydrogel with different final mass fractions of GelMA were observed by scanning electron microscope and the pore size was calculated. On treatment day 1, 3, 7, and 14, the concentration of nano silver released from the hydrogel containing GelMA with final mass fraction of 15% and nano silver with final mass concentration of 10 mg/L was detected by mass spectrometer. At 24 h of culture, the diameters of inhibition zone of GelMA hydrogel containing final mass concentration of 0 (no nano silver), 25, 50, and 100 mg/L nano silver against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli were detected. Fibroblasts (Fbs) and adipose stem cells (ASCs) were isolated respectively by enzymatic digestion using the discarded prepuce after circumcision from a 5-year-old healthy boy who was treated in the Department of Urology of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine in July 2020, and the discarded fat tissue after liposuction from a 23-year-old healthy woman who was treated in the Department of Plastic Surgery of the Hospital in July 2020. The Fbs were divided into blank control group (culture medium only), 2 mg/L nano sliver group, 5 mg/L nano sliver group, 10 mg/L nano sliver group, 25 mg/L nano sliver group, and 50 mg/L nano sliver group, which were added with the corresponding final mass concentrations of nano sliver solution, respectively. At 48 h of culture, the Fb proliferation viability was detected by cell counting kit 8 method. The Fbs were divided into 0 mg/L silver-containing GelMA hydrogel group, 10 mg/L silver-containing GelMA hydrogel group, 50 mg/L silver-containing GelMA hydrogel group, and 100 mg/L silver-containing GelMA hydrogel group and then were correspondingly treated. On culture day 1, 3, and 7, the Fb proliferation viability was detected as before. The ASCs were mixed into GelMA hydrogel and divided into 3D bioprinting group and non-printing group. On culture day 1, 3, and 7, the ASC proliferation viability was detected as before and cell growth was observed by live/dead cell fluorescence staining. The sample numbers in the above experiments were all 3. Four full-thickness skin defect wounds were produced on the back of 18 male Sprague-Dawley rats aged 4 to 6 weeks. The wounds were divided into hydrogel alone group, hydrogel/nano sliver group, hydrogel scaffold/nano sliver group, and hydrogel scaffold/nano sliver/ASC group, and transplanted with the corresponding scaffolds, respectively. On post injury day (PID) 4, 7, 14, and 21, the wound healing was observed and the wound healing rate was calculated (n=6). On PID 7 and 14, histopathological changes of wounds were observed by hematoxylin eosin staining (n=6). On PID 21, collagen deposition of wounds was observed by Masson staining (n=3). Data were statistically analyzed with one-way analysis of variance, analysis of variance for repeated measurement, Bonferroni correction, and independent sample t test. Results: The sliver nano particles in nano silver solution with different mass concentrations were all round, in scattered distribution and uniform in size. The silver-containing GelMA hydrogels with different final mass fractions of GelMA all showed pore structures of different sizes and interconnections. The pore size of silver-containing GelMA hydrogel with 10% final mass fraction was significantly larger than that of silver-containing GelMA hydrogels with 15% and 20% final mass fractions (with P values both below 0.05). On treatment day 1, 3, and 7, the concentration of nano silver released from silver-containing GelMA hydrogel in vitro showed a relatively flat trend. On treatment day 14, the concentration of released nano silver in vitro increased rapidly. At 24 h of culture, the diameters of inhibition zone of GelMA hydrogel containing 0, 25, 50, and 100 mg/L nano silver against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli were 0, 0, 0.7, and 2.1 mm and 0, 1.4, 3.2, and 3.3 mm, respectively. At 48 h of culture, the proliferation activity of Fbs in 2 mg/L nano silver group and 5 mg/L nano silver group was both significantly higher than that in blank control group (P<0.05), and the proliferation activity of Fbs in 10 mg/L nano silver group, 25 mg/L nano silver group, and 50 mg/L nano silver group was all significantly lower than that in blank control group (P<0.05). Compared with the that of Fbs in 0 mg/L silver-containing GelMA hydrogel group, the proliferation activity of Fbs in 50 mg/L silver-containing GelMA hydrogel group and 100 mg/L silver-containing GelMA hydrogel group was all significantly decreased on culture day 1 (P<0.05); the proliferation activity of Fbs in 50 mg/L silver-containing GelMA hydrogel group was significantly increased (P<0.05), while the proliferation activity of Fbs in 100 mg/L silver-containing GelMA hydrogel group was significantly decreased on culture day 3 (P<0.05); the proliferation activity of Fbs in 100 mg/L silver-containing GelMA hydrogel group was significantly decreased on culture day 7 (P<0.05). The proliferation activity of ASCs in 3D bioprinting group show no statistically significant differences to that in non-printing group on culture day 1 (P>0.05). The proliferation activity of ASCs in 3D bioprinting group was significantly higher than that in non-printing group on culture day 3 and 7 (with t values of 21.50 and 12.95, respectively, P<0.05). On culture day 1, the number of dead ASCs in 3D bioprinting group was slightly more than that in non-printing group. On culture day 3 and 5, the majority of ASCs in 3D bioprinting group and non-printing group were living cells. On PID 4, the wounds of rats in hydrogel alone group and hydrogel/nano sliver group had more exudation, and the wounds of rats in hydrogel scaffold/nano sliver group and hydrogel scaffold/nano sliver/ASC group were dry without obvious signs of infection. On PID 7, there was still a small amount of exudation on the wounds of rats in hydrogel alone group and hydrogel/nano sliver group, while the wounds of rats in hydrogel scaffold/nano sliver group and hydrogel scaffold/nano sliver/ASC group were dry and scabbed. On PID 14, the hydrogels on the wound surface of rats in the four groups all fell off. On PID 21, a small area of wounds remained unhealed in hydrogel alone group. On PID 4 and 7, the wound healing rates of rats in hydrogel scaffold/nano sliver/ASC group were significantly higher than those of the other three groups (P<0.05). On PID 14, the wound healing rate of rats in hydrogel scaffold/nano sliver/ASC group was significantly higher than the wound healing rates in hydrogel alone group and hydrogel/nano sliver group (all P<0.05). On PID 21, the wound healing rate of rats in hydrogel alone group was significantly lower than that in hydrogel scaffold/nano sliver/ASC group (P<0.05). On PID 7, the hydrogels on the wound surface of rats in the four groups remained in place; on PID 14, the hydrogel in hydrogel alone group was separated from the wounds of rats, while some hydrogels still existed in the new tissue of the wounds of rats in the other three groups. On PID 21, the collagen arrangement in the wounds of rats in hydrogel alone group was out of order, while the collagen arrangement in the wounds of rats in hydrogel/nano sliver group, and hydrogel scaffold/nano sliver/ASC group was relatively orderly. Conclusions: Silver-containing GelMA hydrogel has good biocompatibility and antibacterial properties. Its three-dimensional bioprinted double-layer structure can better integrate with new formed tissue in the full-thickness skin defect wounds in rats and promote wound healing.

36873455	Stroke and spinal cord injury are common neurological disorders that can cause various dysfunctions. Motor dysfunction is a common dysfunction that easily leads to complications such as joint stiffness and muscle contracture and markedly impairs the daily living activities and long-term prognosis of patients. Orthotic devices can prevent or compensate for motor dysfunctions. Using orthotic devices early can help prevent and correct deformities and treat muscle and joint problems. An orthotic device is also an effective rehabilitation tool for improving motor function and compensatory abilities. In this study, we reviewed the epidemiological characteristics of stroke and spinal cord injury, provided the therapeutic effect and recent advances in the application of conventional and new types of orthotic devices used in stroke and spinal cord injury in different joints of the upper and lower limbs, identified the shortcomings with these orthotics, and suggested directions for future research.

36854247	Tissue mimicking phantoms (TMPs) play an essential role in modern biomedical research as cost-effective quality assurance and training tools, simultaneously contributing to the reduction of animal use. Herein, we present the development and evaluation of an anatomically accurate mouse phantom intended for image-guided thermal ablation and Focused Ultrasound (FUS) applications. The proposed mouse model consists of skeletal and soft tissue mimics, whose design was based on the Computed tomography (CT) scans data of a live mouse. Advantageously, it is compatible with US, CT, and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). The compatibility assessment was focused on the radiological behavior of the phantom due to the lack of relevant literature. The X-ray linear attenuation coefficient of candidate materials was estimated to assess the one that matches best the radiological behavior of living tissues. The bone part was manufactured by Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) printing using Acrylonitrile styrene acrylate (ASA) material. For the soft-tissue mimic, a special mold was 3D printed having a cavity with the unique shape of the mouse body and filled with an agar-based silica-doped gel. The mouse phantom accurately matched the size and reproduced the body surface of the imaged mouse. Tissue-equivalency in terms of X-ray attenuation was demonstrated for the agar-based soft-tissue mimic. The phantom demonstrated excellent MRI visibility of the skeletal and soft-tissue mimics. Good radiological contrast between the skeletal and soft-tissue models was also observed in the CT scans. The model was also able to reproduce realistic behavior during trans-skull sonication as proved by thermocouple measurements. Overall, the proposed phantom is inexpensive, ergonomic, and realistic. It could constitute a powerful tool for image-guided thermal ablation and FUS studies in terms of testing and optimizing the performance of relevant equipment and protocols. It also possess great potential for use in transcranial FUS applications, including the emerging topic of FUS-mediated blood brain barrier (BBB) disruption.

36850120	This study explores the potential of using nanocellulose extracted from oil palm empty fruit bunch (OPEFB) as a biomaterial ink for 3D printing. The research focuses on using nanocellulose hydrogels for the controlled uptake and release of proteins, with the specific protein solution being Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA). To provide a suitable material for the bioprinting process, the study examines the characteristics and properties of the printed hydrogels through various analyses, such as morphology, functional group, crystallinity, and compression test. Several parameters, such as initial concentration, temperature, and the presence of calcium chloride as an additional crosslinker, affect the protein uptake and release capabilities of the hydrogel. The study is important for biomedicine as it explores the behavior of protein uptake and release using nanocellulose and 3D printing and can serve as a preliminary study for using hydrogels in biological materials or living cells.

36844245	212Three-dimensional (3D) printing is a modern, computer-aided, design-based technology that allows the layer-by-layer deposition of 3D structures. Bioprinting, a 3D printing technology, has attracted increasing attention because of its capacity to produce scaffolds for living cells with extreme precision. Along with the rapid development of 3D bioprinting technology, the innovation of bio-inks, which is recognized as the most challenging aspect of this technology, has demonstrated tremendous promise for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Cellulose is the most abundant polymer in nature. Various forms of cellulose, nanocellulose, and cellulose derivatives, including cellulose ethers and cellulose esters, are common bioprintable materials used to develop bio-inks in recent years, owing to their biocompatibility, biodegradability, low cost, and printability. Although various cellulose-based bio-inks have been investigated, the potential applications of nanocellulose and cellulose derivative-based bio-inks have not been fully explored. This review focuses on the physicochemical properties of nanocellulose and cellulose derivatives as well as the recent advances in bio-ink design for 3D bioprinting of bone and cartilage. In addition, the current advantages and disadvantages of these bio-inks and their prospects in 3D printing-based tissue engineering are comprehensively discussed. We hope to offer helpful information for the logical design of innovative cellulose-based materials for use in this sector in the future.

36841919	Adaptations to flow have already been in the focus of early stream research, but till today morphological adaptations of stream insects are hardly understood. While most previous stream research focused on drag, the effects of lift on ground-living stream insects have been often overlooked. Stream mayfly larvae Ecdyonurus sp. graze on algae on top of the stones and therefore inhabit current exposed places in streams. They have a dorso-ventrally flattened body shape, which is known to reduce drag. However, this body shape enhances lift too, increasing the danger for the animal of getting detached from the substrate. Using microscopic techniques, 3D-printing, and drag and lift measurements in a wind tunnel, our experiments show that the widened femora of Ecdyonurus sp. can generate negative lift, contributing to counterbalance the (positive) lift of the overall body shape. The larvae can actively regulate the amount of lift by adjusting the femur's tilt or optimizing the distance to the ground. This shows that morphological adaptations of benthic stream insects can be very elaborate and can reach far beyond adaptations of the overall body shape. In the presented case, Ecdyonurus sp. takes advantage of the flow to overcome the flow's challenges.	Hydrofoil-like legs help stream mayfly larvae to stay on the ground.	2023	Mar	Ditsche Petra;Hoffmann Florian;Kaehlert Sarah;Kesel Antonia;Gorb Stanislav	Drag;Ecdyonurus sp.;Femur;Lift;Torrenticol	Animals;Larva;Ephemeroptera;Biomechanical Phenomena;Rivers;Insecta	Journal of comparative physiology.

36835636	Tissue engineering focuses on the development of materials as biosubstitutes that can be used to regenerate, repair, or replace damaged tissues. Alongside this, 3D printing has emerged as a promising technique for producing implants tailored to specific defects, which in turn increased the demand for new inks and bioinks. Especially supramolecular hydrogels based on nucleosides such as guanosine have gained increasing attention due to their biocompatibility, good mechanical characteristics, tunable and reversible properties, and intrinsic self-healing capabilities. However, most existing formulations exhibit insufficient stability, biological activity, or printability. To address these limitations, we incorporated polydopamine (PDA) into guanosine-borate (GB) hydrogels and developed a PGB hydrogel with maximal PDA incorporation and good thixotropic and printability qualities. The resulting PGB hydrogels exhibited a well-defined nanofibrillar network, and we found that PDA incorporation increased the hydrogel's osteogenic activity while having no negative effect on mammalian cell survival or migration. In contrast, antimicrobial activity was observed against the Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis.

36812580	Although autologous bone (AB) grafting is considered to be the gold standard for cranioplasty, unresolved problems remain, such as surgical-site infections and bone flap absorption. In this study, an AB scaffold was constructed via three-dimensional (3D) bedside-bioprinting technology and used for cranioplasty. To simulate the skull structure, a polycaprolactone shell was designed as an external lamina, and 3D-printed AB and a bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell (BMSC) hydrogel was used to mimic cancellous bone for bone regeneration. Ourin vitroresults showed that the scaffold exhibited excellent cellular affinity and promoted osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs in both two-dimensional and 3D culture systems. The scaffold was implanted in beagle dog cranial defects for up to 9 months, and the scaffold promoted new bone and osteoid formation. Furtherin vivostudies indicated that transplanted BMSCs differentiated into vascular endothelium, cartilage, and bone tissues, whereas native BMSCs were recruited into the defect. The results of this study provide a method for bedside bioprinting of a cranioplasty scaffold for bone regeneration, which opens up another window for clinical applications of 3D printing in the future.	3D bioprinted autologous bone particle scaffolds for cranioplasty promote bone regeneration with both implanted and native BMSCs.	2023	Mar	Huan Yu;Zhou Dezhi;Wu Xiuquan;He Xin;Chen Hongqing;Li Sanzhong;Jia Bo;Dou Yanan;Fei Xiaowei;Wu Shuang;Wei Jialiang;Fei Zhou;Xu Tao;Fei Fei	bedside bioprinting;bone particles;cranioplasty;in-situ differentiation;mesenchymal stem cells	Animals;Dogs;Osteogenesis;Tissue Scaffolds;Bone Regeneration;Mesenchymal Stem Cells;Cell Differentiation;Skull;Printing, Three-Dimensional;Tissue Engineering	Biofabrication	Department of Neurosurgery, Xijing Hospital, Air Force Medical University, Xi'an 710032, People's Republic of China.;Department of Neurosurgery, General Hospital of Northern Theater Command, Shenyang 110840, People's Republic of China.;Biomanufacturing and Rapid Forming Technology Key Laboratory of Beijing, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, People's Republic of China.;Key Laboratory for Advanced Materials Processing Technology, Ministry of Education, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, People's Republic of China.;Department of Neurosurgery, Xijing Hospital, Air Force Medical University, Xi'an 710032, People's Republic of China.;Department of Neurosurgery, Xijing Hospital, Air Force Medical University, Xi'an 710032, People's Republic of China.;Department of Neurosurgery, Xijing Hospital, Air Force Medical University, Xi'an 710032, People's Republic of China.;Department of Neurosurgery, Xijing Hospital, Air Force Medical University, Xi'an 710032, People's Republic of China.;Department of Neurosurgery, Xijing Hospital, Air Force Medical University, Xi'an 710032, People's Republic of China.;Department of Neurosurgery, Xijing Hospital, Air Force Medical University, Xi'an 710032, People's Republic of China.;Department of Neurosurgery, Xijing Hospital, Air Force Medical University, Xi'an 710032, People's Republic of China.;Department of Neurosurgery, Xijing Hospital, Air Force Medical University, Xi'an 710032, People's Republic of China.;Department of Neurosurgery, Xijing Hospital, Air Force Medical University, Xi'an 710032, People's Republic of China.;Department of Neurosurgery, Xijing Hospital, Air Force Medical University, Xi'an 710032, People's Republic of China.;Biomanufacturing and Rapid Forming Technology Key Laboratory of Beijing, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, People's Republic of China.;Key Laboratory for Advanced Materials Processing Technology, Ministry of Education, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, People's Republic of China.;Department of Precision Medicine and Healthcare, Tsinghua-Berkeley Shenzhen Institute, Shenzhen 518055, People's Republic of China.;Center for Bio-intelligent Manufacturing and Living Matter Bioprinting, Research Institute of Tsinghua University in Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518057, People's Republic of China.;Department of Ophthalmology, Xijing Hospital, Air Force Medical University, Xi'an 710032, People's Republic of China.

36808712	Nerve guidance conduits (NGCs) have become a promising alternative for peripheral nerve regeneration; however, the outcome of nerve regeneration and functional recovery is greatly affected by the physical, chemical, and electrical properties of NGCs. In this study, a conductive multiscale filled NGC (MF-NGC) consisting of electrospun poly(lactide-co-caprolactone) (PCL)/collagen nanofibers as the sheath, reduced graphene oxide /PCL microfibers as the backbone, and PCL microfibers as the internal structure for peripheral nerve regeneration is developed. The printed MF-NGCs presented good permeability, mechanical stability, and electrical conductivity, which further promoted the elongation and growth of Schwann cells and neurite outgrowth of PC12 neuronal cells. Animal studies using a rat sciatic nerve injury model reveal that the MF-NGCs promote neovascularization and M2 transition through the rapid recruitment of vascular cells and macrophages. Histological and functional assessments of the regenerated nerves confirm that the conductive MF-NGCs significantly enhance peripheral nerve regeneration, as indicated by improved axon myelination, muscle weight increase, and sciatic nerve function index. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using 3D-printed conductive MF-NGCs with hierarchically oriented fibers as functional conduits that can significantly enhance peripheral nerve regeneration.	3D Printed Conductive Multiscale Nerve Guidance Conduit with Hierarchical Fibers for Peripheral Nerve Regeneration.	2023	Apr	Fang Yongcong;Wang Chengjin;Liu Zibo;Ko Jeonghoon;Chen Li;Zhang Ting;Xiong Zhuo;Zhang Lei;Sun Wei	3D bioprinting;aligned microfiber;graphene oxide;nerve guidance conduits;nerve regeneration	Printing, Three-Dimensional;Nerve Regeneration;Sciatic Nerve;Electrochemical Techniques;Neurites;Animals;Rats;Cell Line	Advanced science (Weinheim, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany)	"Biomanufacturing Center, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, 100084, P.

36808494	Three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting technology offers great potential in the treatment of tissue and organ damage. Conventional approaches generally rely on a large form factor desktop bioprinter to create in vitro 3D living constructs before introducing them into the patient's body, which poses several drawbacks such as surface mismatches, structure damage, and high contamination along with tissue injury due to transport and large open-field surgery. In situ bioprinting inside a living body is a potentially transformational solution as the body serves as an excellent bioreactor. This work introduces a multifunctional and flexible in situ 3D bioprinter (F3DB), which features a high degree of freedom soft printing head integrated into a flexible robotic arm to deliver multilayered biomaterials to internal organs/tissues. The device has a master-slave architecture and is operated by a kinematic inversion model and learning-based controllers. The 3D printing capabilities with different patterns, surfaces, and on a colon phantom are also tested with different composite hydrogels and biomaterials. The F3DB capability to perform endoscopic surgery is further demonstrated with fresh porcine tissue. The new system is expected to bridge a gap in the field of in situ bioprinting and support the future development of advanced endoscopic surgical robots.

36796025	Creating functional tissues and organs in vitro on demand is a major goal in biofabrication, but the ability to replicate the external geometry of specific organs and their internal structures such as blood vessels simultaneously remains one of the greatest impediments. Here, this limitation is addressed by developing a generalizable bioprinting strategy of sequential printing in a reversible ink template (SPIRIT). It is demonstrated that this microgel-based biphasic (MB) bioink can be used as both an excellent bioink and a suspension medium that supports embedded 3D printing due to its shear-thinning and self-healing behavior. When encapsulating human-induced pluripotent stem cells, the MB bioink is 3D printed to generate cardiac tissues and organoids by extensive stem cell proliferation and cardiac differentiation. By incorporating MB bioink, the SPIRIT strategy enables the effective printing of a ventricle model with a perfusable vascular network, which is not possible to fabricate using extant 3D printing strategies. This SPIRIT technique offers an unparalleled bioprinting capability to replicate the complex organ geometry and internal structure in a faster manner, which will accelerate the biofabrication and therapeutic applications of tissue and organ constructs.

36772801	Cell transplant therapies show potential as treatments for a large number of diseases. The encapsulation of cells within hydrogels is often used to mimic the extracellular matrix and protect cells from the body's immune response. However, cell encapsulation can be limited in terms of both scaffold size and cell viability due to poor nutrient and waste transport throughout the bulk of larger volume hydrogels. Strategies to address this issue include creating prevascularized or porous structured materials. For example, cell-laden hydrogels can be formed by porogen leaching or three-dimensional printing, but these techniques involve the use of multiple materials, long preparation times, and/or specialized equipment. Postfabrication cell seeding in porous scaffolds can result in inconsistent cell density throughout scaffold volumes and typically requires a bioreactor to ensure even cell distribution. In this study, we developed a highly cytocompatible direct cell encapsulation method during the rapid fabrication of porous hydrogels. Using sodium bicarbonate and citric acid as blowing agents, we employed photocurable polymers to produce highly porous materials within a matter of minutes. Cells were directly encapsulated within methacrylated poly(vinyl alcohol), poly(ethylene glycol), and gelatin hydrogels at viabilities as high as 93% by controlling solution variables, such as citric acid content, viscosity, pH, and curing time. Cell viability within the resulting porous constructs was high (>80%) over 14 days of analysis with multiple cell types. This work provides a simple, versatile, and tunable method for cell encapsulation within highly porous constructs that can be built upon in future work for the delivery of cell-based therapies. Impact Statement This simple method to obtain cell-laden hydrogel foams allows direct cell encapsulation within biomaterials without the need for porogens or microcarriers, while maintaining high cell viability. The successful encapsulation of multiple cell types into gas-blown hydrogels with varied chemistries shows the versatility of this method. While this work focuses on photocrosslinkable polymers, any quick gelling material could be used for foam fabrication in expansion of this work. The potential future impact of this work on the treatment of diseases and injuries that utilize cell therapies is wide-ranging.

36758283	Hydrogels are commonly used in 3D bioprinting technology owing to their ability to encapsulate living cells. However, their inherent delicate properties limit their applicability in the fabrication of mechanically reliable tissue engineering constructs. Herein, we propose a novel reinvented layering integration method for the functional enhancement of 3D cell-hydrogel bioprinting. This was implemented by inserting electrospun microfiber sheets with a crosslinker between the 3D bioprinted layers. When surface-modified microfiber sheets were combined with Ca2+ ionic crosslinkers, the as-printed cell-hydrogel strand was immediately crosslinked when it contacted the sheet surface. The in-situ crosslinking in the bioprinting process not only improved the overall structural stability, but also reinforced the compressive strength and elastic modulus. The enhanced structural stability guaranteed the shape fidelity of the 3D architecture, which included the internal channel network, resulting in improved perfusion conditions for cell growth. The growth of NIH3T3 fibroblasts in 3D bioconstructs with in-situ crosslinking increased by up to five times compared to that of normally bioprinted constructs. The strengthened structural integrity was distinctly sustainable during the cell culture period owing to the sustained release of Ca2+ ions from the embedded microfiber sheets. The synergistic effect of the reinforced mechanical properties with enhanced cell growth is expected to extend the applicability of the proposed hydrogel-based bioprinting technique for soft tissue engineering.

36751955	In tissue engineering and regenerative medicine, nature's template is the extracellular matrix (ECM) which provides mechanical support and biochemical signals to encourage cell attachment and modulate cell behavior. Biological and biomimetic materials derived from the decellularized ECM (dECM) are successfully used in a variety of biomedical therapies both in preclinical studies and clinical applications. One of the main goals of decellularization is the elimination of cellular components from tissue samples or whole organs while maintaining their resident regulatory molecules and mechanical integrity. The coupling of decellularized bioproducts with computer-aided fabrication technologies such as three-dimensional (3D) printing, is revolutionizing tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Following the growth of different computer-aided scaffolding methods, 3D bioprinting offers the possibility of incorporating different cells into the biomaterial formulation to produce a cell-laden structure. Suitable materials for 3D bioprinting are often referred to as bioinks and have become an important field research area. The concept of bioink, originally considered a printable hydrogel that incorporated living cells, has recently changed. That is to say, biomaterials that can be printed and subsequently seeded with cells after printing, do not qualify as a bioink. However, the 3D printing of biomaterial inks and bioinks of dECM for cartilage regeneration is still burgeoning. Cartilage possesses uniquely complex mechanical properties that are integral to tissue function and can be attributed to the ECM network. Hence, using a printed dECM scaffold could be an encouraging approach to engineering cartilage while preserving its depth-dependent ECM structure. This paper provides an overview of the composition and structure of cartilage ECM and 3D printing and bioprinting of dECM-related scaffolds, emphasizing cartilage function.

36748277	"For regeneration of highly vascularized and innervated tissues, like bone, simultaneous ingrowth of blood vessels and nerves is essential but largely neglected. To address this issue, a ""pre-angiogenic"" cell-laden scaffold with durable angiogenic functions is prepared according to the bioactivities of silicate bioceramics and the instructive effects of vascular cells on neurogenesis and bone repair. Compared with traditional cell-free scaffolds, the prepared cell-laden scaffolds printed with active cells and bioactive inks can support long-term cell survival and growth for three weeks. The long-lived scaffolds exhibited durable angiogenic capability both in vitro and in vivo. The pre-angiogenic scaffolds can induce the neurogenetic differentiation of neural cells and the osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells by the synergistic effects of released bioactive ions and the ability of vascular cells to attract neurons. The enhanced bone regeneration with both vascularization and innervation is attributed to these physiological functions of the pre-angiogenic cell-laden scaffolds, which is defined as ""vascular-innervated"" bone regeneration. It is suggested that the concept of ""vascular-innervated scaffolds"" may represent the future direction of biomaterials for complex tissue/organ regeneration."

36731696	With the advancement in 3D bioprinting technology, cell culture methods can design 3D environments which are both, complex and physiologically relevant. The main component in 3D bioprinting, bioink, can be split into various categories depending on the criterion of categorization. Although the choice of bioink and bioprinting process will vary greatly depending on the application, general features such as material properties, biological interaction, gelation, and viscosity are always important to consider. The foundation of 3D bioprinting is the exact layer-by-layer implantation of biological elements, biochemicals, and living cells with the spatial control of the implantation of functional elements onto the biofabricated 3D structure. Three basic strategies underlie the 3D bioprinting process: autonomous self-assembly, micro tissue building blocks, and biomimicry or biomimetics. Tissue engineering can benefit from 3D bioprinting in many ways, but there are still numerous obstacles to overcome before functional tissues can be produced and used in clinical settings. A better comprehension of the physiological characteristics of bioink materials and a higher level of ability to reproduce the intricate biologically mimicked and physiologically relevant 3D structures would be a significant improvement for 3D bioprinting to overcome the limitations.

36681865	Living creatures possess complex geometries, exceptional adaptability, and continuous growing and regenerating characteristics, which are difficult for synthetic materials to imitate simultaneously. A living polymer network with these features is reported. The polymer can be digitally printed into arbitrary 3D shapes and subsequently undergoes growth via living polymerization of a monomer as the nutrient. This leads to macroscopic dimensional growth and transforms the printed amorphous network into a crystallizable network, resulting in geometric adaptability via a shape-memory mechanism. By controlling the localized growth, an initial homogeneous structure can be converted into a geometrically different heterogeneous structure composed of materials with different properties (crystallization and mechanical properties). After growth, the original network can be chemically regenerated for regrowth. With this regenerative living 4D printing, one 3D-printed seed template can be turned into different derivatives with distinct geometries and mechanical properties when repeated regeneration is conducted in different localized regions and the degree of regrowth is varied.

36677223	Microrobots and nanorobots have been produced with various nature-inspired soft materials and operating mechanisms. However, freely operating a wirelessly miniaturized soft robot remains a challenge. In this study, a wireless crawling compact soft robot using induction heating was developed. The magnetic composite heater built into the robot was heated wirelessly via induction heating, causing a phase change in the working fluid surrounding the heater. The pressure generated from the evaporated fluid induces the bending of the robot, which is composed of elastomers. During one cycle of bending by heating and shrinking by cooling, the difference in the frictional force between the two legs of the robot causes it to move forward. This robot moved 7240 μm, representing 103% of its body length, over nine repetitions. Because the robot's surface is made of biocompatible materials, it offers new possibilities for a soft exploratory microrobot that can be used inside a living body or in a narrow pipe.

36671955	Absorbance spectroscopy finds many biomedical and physical applications ranging from studying the atomic and molecular details of the analyte to determination of unknown biological species and their concentration or activity in the samples. Commercially available laboratory-based spectrometers are usually bulky and require high power and laborious manual processing, making them unsuitable to be deployed in portable and space-constrained environments, thereby further limiting their utility for real-time on-site monitoring. To address these challenges, here we developed a portable 3D-printed multispectral spectrophotometer based on absorbance spectroscopy for real-time monitoring of enzyme molecular activity. Monitoring enzyme (such as tyrosinase) activity is critical, as it quantifies its reaction rate, which is dependent on many factors such as the enzyme and substrate concentrations, temperature, pH, and other regulators such as inhibitors and effectors. Tyrosinase is a critical enzyme responsible for melanin synthesis in living beings and exhibits enzymatic browning in fruits and vegetables. It finds various commercial applications in the fields of healthcare (skin pigmentation, wound healing, etc.), forensics, and food processing. Here, tyrosinase activity was monitored using a 3D-printed spectral sensor at different rates and compared against measurements obtained from laboratory instruments. The enzyme activity was also studied using kojic acid (i.e., a commonly employed commercial tyrosinase inhibitor) while varying its molar and volume concentrations to control the reaction rate at discrete activity levels. For tyrosinase activity monitoring, the fabricated device has shown significant correlation (R2 = 0.9999) compared to measurements from the standard table-top spectrophotometer. We also provide a performance comparison between the 3D-printed and the laboratory spectrophotometer instruments by studying tyrosinase enzyme activity with and without the influence of an inhibitor. Such a device can be translated into various absorbance spectroscopy-based point-of-care biomedical and healthcare applications.

36669550	Multifunctional bone substitute materials (BSM) have gained considerable attention with the exponential increase in aging populations. The development of hybrid materials for diagnosis and therapy of bone-related diseases and dysfunctions, especially, has been a significant challenge in the biological and the biomedical field, due to the shortage of agents with specificity and selectivity toward bone. In this study, a hybrid material, referred as Alen-CDs@CDHA, fabricated from alendronate-conjugated carbon dots (Alen-CDs) and calcium-deficient hydroxyapatite (CDHA, the mineral component of bones) scaffolds is offered as a novel multifunctional BSM for in vivo osteoclasts deactivation and fluorescence imaging. The fluorescent Alen-CDs were hydrothermally prepared using phytic acid as carbon source, followed by conjugating alendronate, for controlled alendronate release and fluorescent imaging under acidic conditions. As-prepared fluorescent Alen-CDs were consecutively immobilized on surfaces of CDHA scaffolds, exhibiting high affinity by bisphosphonate group, easily fabricated from α-tricalcium phosphate (α-TCP) paste using three-dimensional (3D) printing system. The resultant Alen-CDs@CDHA caused a significant decrease (> 50%) in viability of osteoclasts at 7 days after in vitro treatment. Furthermore, when Alen-CDs@CDHA was implanted in balb/c nude mice for in vivo evaluation, we found Alen-CDs@CDHA to be suitable for bone imaging through fluorescence signals, without necrosis or inflammatory symptoms in the epidermal tissues. Thus, these observations offer new opportunities for a novel and revolutionary use of Alen-CDs@CDHA as highly specific multifunctional BSM for bone diagnosis and imaging, and as bone-specific drug delivery materials, eventually providing anti-osteoclastogenic treatments solution for degenerative bone disorders. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Alen-CDs@CDHA significantly reduced the viability of osteoclasts and fluorescently imaged in vivo after transplantation, releasing drug via pH modulation. The development of fluorescence materials for bone imaging remains still a major challenge in the biomedical field owing to the shortage of selectivity and specificity. The results could lead to improvements in bone treatment strategies, as it could reduce the invasiveness of procedures and the associated negative outcomes, and increase the precision of strategies. Further, we believe that this study will be of interest to the readership of your journal as clearly focuses on the advancement of a biomaterial, where we have engineered a substance to substitute bone and integrate with a living system.

36669131	A cellulose nanofibril-based hybrid gel material was developed by grafting the polymerized stearyl acrylate (PSA) and upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) onto cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs) via Cu0-mediated radical polymerization (SET-LRP) to create a highly cross-linked CNF system. A two-step strategy was exploited to surface-exchange the ligand of the UCNPs from a hydrophobic ligand (oleic acid) to a hydrophilic small-molecule ligand (2-acrylamido-2-methyl-1-propanesulfonic acid, AMPS) and therefore be suitable for SET-LRP. The characteristics and properties of the hybrid material (UCNP-PSA-CNF) were monitored by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), rheology, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and microscopic analysis. Those characterization techniques prove the efficient modification of the CNF, with the presence of 1.8% UCNPs. The luminescence measurement was carried out using a homebuilt confocal microscope with a 980 nm laser source. The nanostructure of UCNPs and their incorporated CNF species were measured by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). In addition, this CNF-based hybrid gel has decisive rheological properties, such as good viscoelasticity (loss tangent was below 0.35 for the UCNP-PSA-CNF gel, while the PSA-CNF gel reached the highest value of 0.42), shear-thinning behavior, and shape retention, and was successfully applied to three-dimensional (3D) gel printing throughout various 3D print models.	3D Printable Hybrid Gel Made of Polymer Surface-Modified Cellulose Nanofibrils Prepared by Surface-Initiated Controlled Radical Polymerization (SI-SET-LRP) and Upconversion Luminescent Nanoparticles.	2023	Feb	Jiang Xuehe;Mietner J Benedikt;Harder Constantin;Komban Rajesh;Chen Shouzheng;Strelow Christian;Sazama Uta;Fröba Michael;Gimmler Christoph;Müller-Buschbaum Peter;Roth Stephan V;Navarro Julien R G	3D gel printing;cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs);cellulose-based hybrid material;single electron transfer living radical polymerization (SET-LRP);upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs)		ACS applied materials & interfaces	Institute of Wood Science, University Hamburg, Leuschnerstraße 91, 21031 Hamburg, Germany.;Institute of Wood Science, University Hamburg, Leuschnerstraße 91, 21031 Hamburg, Germany.;Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron DESY, Notkestrasse 85, 22607 Hamburg, Germany.;Fraunhofer Center for Applied Nanotechnology CAN, Grindelallee 117, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany.;Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron DESY, Notkestrasse 85, 22607 Hamburg, Germany.;Department of Chemistry, Institute of Physical Chemistry, University Hamburg, Grindelallee 117, 20146 Hamburg, Germany.;Department of Chemistry, Institute of Inorganic and Applied Chemistry, University Hamburg, Martin-Luther-King-Platz 6, 20146 Hamburg, Germany.;Department of Chemistry, Institute of Inorganic and Applied Chemistry, University Hamburg, Martin-Luther-King-Platz 6, 20146 Hamburg, Germany.;Fraunhofer Center for Applied Nanotechnology CAN, Grindelallee 117, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany.;Physik-Department, Lehrstuhl für Funtionelle Materielien, Technische Universität München, James-Franck-Strasse 1, 85748 Garching, Germany.;Technical University of Munich, Heinz Maier-Leibnitz Zentrum (MLZ), Lichtenbergstr. 1, 85748 Garching, Germany.;Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron DESY, Notkestrasse 85, 22607 Hamburg, Germany.;Institute of Wood Science, University Hamburg, Leuschnerstraße 91, 21031 Hamburg, Germany.

36658120	Living materials bring together material science and biology to allow the engineering and augmenting of living systems with novel functionalities. Bioprinting promises accurate control over the formation of such complex materials through programmable deposition of cells in soft materials, but current approaches had limited success in fine-tuning cell microenvironments while generating robust macroscopic morphologies. Here, we address this challenge through the use of core-shell microgel ink to decouple cell microenvironments from the structural shell for further processing. Cells are microfluidically immobilized in the viscous core that can promote the formation of both microbial populations and mammalian cellular spheroids, followed by interparticle annealing to give covalently stabilized functional scaffolds with controlled microporosity. The results show that the core-shell strategy mitigates cell leakage while affording a favorable environment for cell culture. Furthermore, we demonstrate that different microbial consortia can be printed into scaffolds for a range of applications. By compartmentalizing microbial consortia in separate microgels, the collective bioprocessing capability of the scaffold is significantly enhanced, shedding light on strategies to augment living materials with bioprocessing capabilities.

36644783	"Bio-based polymers are a class of polymers made by living organisms, a few of them known and commercialized yet. Due to poor mechanical strength and economic constraints, they have not yet seen the extensive application. Instead, they have been an appropriate candidate for biological applications. Growing consumer knowledge of the environmental effect of polymers generated from petrochemical sources and a worldwide transition away from plastics with a lifespan of hundreds of years has resulted in greater interest in such hitherto unattainable sectors. Bio-based polymers come in various forms, including direct or ""drop-in"" replacements for their petrochemical counterparts with nearly identical properties or completely novel polymers that were previously unavailable, such as polylactide. Few of these bio-based polymers offer significantly improved technical specifications than their alternatives. Polylactic acid (PLA) has been well known in the last decade as a biodegradable thermoplastic source for use in 3DP by the ""fused deposition modeling"" method. The PLA market is anticipated to accomplish 5.2 billion US dollars in 2020 for its industrial usage. Conversely, 3DP is one of the emerging technologies with immense economic potential in numerous sectors where PLA is one of the critical options as the polymer source due to its environmentally friendly nature, glossiness, multicolor appearance, and ease of printing. The chemical structure, manufacturing techniques, standard features, and current market situation of PLA were examined in this study. This review looks at the process of 3DP that uses PLA filaments in extrusion-based 3DP technologies in particular. Several recent articles describing 3D-printed PLA items have been highlighted."	3D printing of polylactic acid: recent advances and opportunities.	2023		Joseph Tomy Muringayil;Kallingal Anoop;Suresh Akshay Maniyeri;Mahapatra Debarshi Kar;Hasanin Mohamed S;Haponiuk Józef;Thomas Sabu	3DP;Additive manufacturing;Fused deposition modeling;Green polymers;Polylactic acid		The International journal, advanced manufacturing technology	Department of Polymers Technology, Faculty of Chemistry, Gdańsk University of Technology, G.

36636132	In situ bioprinting has emerged as a promising technology for tissue and organ engineering based on the precise positioning of living cells, growth factors, and biomaterials. Rather than traditional in vitro reconstruction and recapitulation of tissue or organ models, the in situ technology can directly print on specific anatomical positions in living bodies. The requirements for biological activity, function, and mechanical property in an in vivo setting are more complex. By combining progressive innovations of biomaterials, tissue engineering, and digitalization, especially robotics, in situ bioprinting has gained significant interest from the academia and industry, demonstrating its prospect for clinical studies. This article reviews the progress of in situ bioprinting, with an emphasis on robotic-assisted studies. The main modalities for in situ three-dimensional bioprinting, which include extrusion-based printing, inkjet printing, laser-based printing, and their derivatives, are briefly introduced. These modalities have been integrated with various custom-tailored printers (i.e., end effectors) mounted on robotic arms for dexterous and precision biofabrication. The typical prototypes based on various robot configurations, including Cartesian, articulated, and parallel mechanisms, for in situ bioprinting are discussed and compared. The conventional and most recent applications of robotic-assisted methods for in situ fabrication of tissue and organ models, including cartilage, bone, and skin, are also elucidated, followed by a discussion on the existing challenges in this field with their corresponding suggestions.

36635264	The vascularization of engineered tissues and organoids has remained a major unresolved challenge in regenerative medicine. While multiple approaches have been developed to vascularize in vitro tissues, it has thus far not been possible to generate sufficiently dense networks of small-scale vessels to perfuse large de novo tissues. Here, we achieve the perfusion of multi-mm3 tissue constructs by generating networks of synthetic capillary-scale 3D vessels. Our 3D soft microfluidic strategy is uniquely enabled by a 3D-printable 2-photon-polymerizable hydrogel formulation, which allows for precise microvessel printing at scales below the diffusion limit of living tissues. We demonstrate that these large-scale engineered tissues are viable, proliferative and exhibit complex morphogenesis during long-term in-vitro culture, while avoiding hypoxia and necrosis. We show by scRNAseq and immunohistochemistry that neural differentiation is significantly accelerated in perfused neural constructs. Additionally, we illustrate the versatility of this platform by demonstrating long-term perfusion of developing neural and liver tissue. This fully synthetic vascularization platform opens the door to the generation of human tissue models at unprecedented scale and complexity.

36618954	The outburst of the fourth Industrial Revolution had a significant impact on many aspects of life. The discovery of new technologies in medicine has resulted in innovations: organ transplants. The introduction of three-dimensional (3D) organ printing technology promises improvements to the field. Organs such as the liver, kidneys, heart and others are printed to meet the needs of the actual organs. However, the production of prototype organs to replace the original organs is associated with the issue of changing the creation of Allah. Accordingly, this study will analyse the issue of changing the creation of God in three-dimensional (3D) organ printing technology according to the perspective of Islamic law. Several appropriate methodologies in Islamic law (usul fiqh) are used such as legal reasoning through maqasid shariah perspective and analogical reasoning. The result shows that three-dimensional (3D) organ printing technology falls under the permissible category of changing the creation of Allah because it can save human lives. The production of organs through 3D printing involving changes included in the category of necessity (daruri) and need (hajiy) is permissible, but the category of desirable (tahsini) requires further specifications.

36606680	Bioprinting, a technology that allows depositing living cells and biomaterials together into a complex tissue architecture with desired pattern, becomes a revolutionary technology for fabrication of engineered constructs. Previously, we have demonstrated that EphrinB2-modified dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) are expected to be promising seed cells with enhanced osteogenic differentiation capability for alveolar bone regeneration. In this study, we aimed to bioprint EphrinB2-overexpressing DPSCs with low-concentrated Gelatin methacrylate (GelMA) hydrogels into three-dimensional (3D) constructs. The printability of GelMA (5% w/v) and the structural fidelity of bioprinted constructs were examined. Then, viability, proliferation, morphology, and osteogenic differentiation of DPSCs in bioprinted constructs were measured. Finally, the effect of EphrinB2 overexpression on osteogenic differentiation of DPSCs in bioprinted constructs was evaluated. Our results demonstrated that GelMA (5% w/v) in a physical gel form was successfully bioprinted into constructs with various shapes and patterns using optimized printing parameters. Embedded DPSCs showed round-like morphology, and had a high viability (91.93% ± 8.38%) and obvious proliferation (∼1.9-fold increase) 1 day after printing. They also showed excellent osteogenic potential in bioprinted constructs. In bioprinted 3D constructs, EphrinB2-overexpressing DPSCs expressed upregulated osteogenic markers, including ALP, BMP2, RUNX2, and SP7, and generated more mineralized nodules, as compared with Vector-DPSCs. Taken together, this study indicated that fabrication of bioprinted EphrinB2-DPSCs-laden constructs with enhanced osteogenic potential was possible, and 3D bioprinting strategy combined with EphrinB2 gene modification was a promising way to create bioengineered constructs for alveolar bone regeneration.

36585374	Embedded 3D bioprinting has great value for the freeform fabrication of living matter. However, embedded 3D bioprinting is currently limited to highly viscous liquid baths or liquid-like solid baths. In contrast, prior to crosslinking, most hydrogels are formulated as low-viscosity solutions and are therefore not directly compatible with bioprinting due to low shape fidelity and poor print stability. The authors here present a method to enable low-viscosity ink 3D (LoV3D) bioprinting, based on aqueous two-phase stabilization of the ink-bath interface. LoV3D allows for the printing of living constructs at high extrusion speeds (up to 1.8 m s-1 ) with high viability due to its exceedingly low-viscosity. Moreover, LoV3D liquid/liquid interfaces offer unique advantages for fusing printed structures, creating intricate vasculature, and modifying surfaces at higher efficiencies than traditional systems. Furthermore, the low interfacial tension of LoV3D bioprinting offers unprecedented nozzle-independent control over filament diameter via large-dimension strand-thinning, which allows for the printing of an exceptionally wide range of diameters down to the width of a single cell. Overall, LoV3D bioprinting is a unique all-aqueous approach with broad material compatibility without the need for rheological ink adaption, which opens new avenues of application in cell patterning, drug screening, engineered meat, and organ fabrication.

36582305	3D bioprinting or additive manufacturing is an emerging innovative technology revolutionizing the field of biomedical applications by combining engineering, manufacturing, art, education, and medicine. This process involved incorporating the cells with biocompatible materials to design the required tissue or organ model in situ for various in vivo applications. Conventional 3D printing is involved in constructing the model without incorporating any living components, thereby limiting its use in several recent biological applications. However, this uses additional biological complexities, including material choice, cell types, and their growth and differentiation factors. This state-of-the-art technology consciously summarizes different methods used in bioprinting and their importance and setbacks. It also elaborates on the concept of bioinks and their utility. Biomedical applications such as cancer therapy, tissue engineering, bone regeneration, and wound healing involving 3D printing have gained much attention in recent years. This article aims to provide a comprehensive review of all the aspects associated with 3D bioprinting, from material selection, technology, and fabrication to applications in the biomedical fields. Attempts have been made to highlight each element in detail, along with the associated available reports from recent literature.

36550372	Biological living materials, such as animal bones and plant stems, are able to self-heal, regenerate, adapt and make decisions under environmental pressures. Despite recent successful efforts to imbue synthetic materials with some of these remarkable functionalities, many emerging properties of complex adaptive systems found in biology remain unexplored in engineered living materials. Here, we describe a three-dimensional printing approach that harnesses the emerging properties of fungal mycelia to create living complex materials that self-repair, regenerate and adapt to the environment while fulfilling an engineering function. Hydrogels loaded with the fungus Ganoderma lucidum are three-dimensionally printed into lattice architectures to enable mycelial growth in a balanced exploration and exploitation pattern that simultaneously promotes colonization of the gel and bridging of air gaps. To illustrate the potential of such mycelium-based living complex materials, we three-dimensionally print a robotic skin that is mechanically robust, self-cleaning and able to autonomously regenerate after damage.

36527264	Engineering living bone tissue of defined shape on-demand has remained a challenge. 3D bioprinting (3DBP), a biofabrication process capable of yielding cell constructs of defined shape, when combined with developmental engineering can provide a possible path forward. Through the development of a bioink possessing appropriate rheological properties to carry a high cell load and concurrently yield physically stable structures, printing of stable, cell-laden, single-matrix constructs of anatomical shapes is realized without the need for fugitive or support phases. Using this bioink system, constructs of hypertrophic cartilage of predesigned geometry are engineered in vitro by printing human mesenchymal stromal cells at a high density to drive spontaneous condensation and implanted in nude mice to evoke endochondral ossification. The implanted constructs retain their prescribed shape over a 12-week period and undergo remodeling to yield ossicles of the designed shape with neovascularization. Microcomputed tomography, histological, and immunohistochemistry assessments confirm bone tissue characteristics and the presence of human cells. These results demonstrate the potential of 3DBP to fabricate complex bone tissue for clinical application.

36524860	Supramolecular hydrogels are of great interest in tissue scaffolding, diagnostics, and drug delivery due to their biocompatibility and stimuli-responsive properties. In particular, nucleosides are promising candidates as building blocks due to their manifold noncovalent interactions and ease of chemical modification. Significant progress in the field has been made over recent years to allow the use of nucleoside-based supramolecular hydrogels in the biomedical field, namely drug delivery and 3D bioprinting. For example, their long-term stability, printability, functionality, and bioactivity have been greatly improved by employing more than one gelator, incorporating different cations, including silver for antibacterial activity, or using additives such as boric acid or even biomolecules. This now permits their use as bioinks for 3D printing to produce cell-laden scaffolds with specified geometries and pore sizes as well as a homogeneous distribution of living cells and bioactive molecules. We have summarized the latest advances in nucleoside-based supramolecular hydrogels.

36520018	Probiotic cellulose (PC), a living material (LM) consisting of probiotics integrated into bacterial cellulose, is the first example where life (probiotic proliferation) is the input to tune the viscoelasticity of the biomaterial. The gradual proliferation of probiotics within the matrix acts as a key modulator of the cellulose viscoelasticity, providing from celluloses with lower-than-matrix viscoelasticity to celluloses with viscoelastic moduli closer to those of elastic solids. This concept is a promising approach to producing living bio-ink with tunable viscoelastic response of special interest for specific applications such as 3D printing. In contrast to the most common hydrogels with stimuli-tunable mechanical properties, which require external stimuli such as mechanical stress, UV radiation, or heat, this living bio-ink only requires time to tune from a fluid-like into a solid-like biomaterial.

36511313	3D printing has emerged as a powerful way to produce complex materials on-demand. These printing technologies are now being applied in microbiology, with many recent examples where microbes and matrices are co-printed to create bespoke living materials. Here, we propose a new paradigm for microbial printing. In addition to its importance for materials, we argue that printing can be used to understand and engineer microbiome communities, analogous to its use in human tissue engineering. Many microbes naturally live in diverse, spatially structured communities that are challenging to study and manipulate. 3D printing offers an exciting new solution to these challenges, as it can precisely arrange microbes in 3D space, allowing one to build custom microbial communities for a wide range of purposes in research, medicine, and industry.	3D printing of microbial communities: A new platform for understanding and engineering microbiomes.	2023	Mar	Krishna Kumar Ravinash;Foster Kevin R		Humans;Tissue Engineering;Printing, Three-Dimensional;Microbiota	Microbial biotechnology	Centre for Bioengineering, School of Engineering and Materials Science, Queen Mary University of London, London, UK.;Department of Chemistry, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.;Department of Biochemistry, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.;Department of Biology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.

Here, it is shown that bacteria-laden hydrogels can be shaped into living materials with unusual architectures and functionalities using readily available light-based printing techniques. Bioluminescent and melanin-producing bacteria are used to create complex materials with autonomous chemical-sensing capabilities by harnessing the metabolic activity of wild-type and engineered microorganisms. The shaping freedom offered by printing technologies and the rich biochemical diversity available in bacteria provides ample design space for the creation and exploration of complex living materials with programmable functionalities for a broad range of applications.

36401767	Cardiovascular disease is one of the main diseases that endanger human life and health, and heart failure often occurs when the cardiovascular disease develops to the end-stage. Heart transplantation is the most effective treatment. However, there has always been a shortage of living heart organs. With the development of regenerative medicine, researchers have turned to bioprinting technology that can build tissues and organs in vitro. A large number of relevant literature on three-dimensional (3D) bioprinted hearts were searched and screened in Google Scholar. 3D bioprinting technology can accurately print biomaterials containing living cells into 3D functional living tissues, providing a feasible solution to the shortage of transplantable organs. As one of the most important organs in the human body, the research on 3D bioprinting of the heart has currently become a hot topic. This paper briefly overviews 3D bioprinting technology and the progress in bioprinting cardiac tissue. It is believed that in the future, bio-printed hearts will become a reality, making a new way of providing artificial organs for heart transplantation.

36373498	Tympanic membrane perforation is a common condition in clinical otolaryngology. Although some eardrum patients can self-heal, a long period of non-healing perforation leads to persistent otitis media, conductive deafness, and poor quality of life. Tympanic membrane repair with autologous materials requires a second incision, and the sampling site may get infected. It is challenging to repair tympanic membranes while maintaining high functionality, safety, affordability, and aesthetics. 3D bioprinting can be used to fabricate tissue patches with materials, factors, and cells in a design manner. This paper reviews 3D printing technology that is being used widely in recent years to construct eardrum stents and the utilized applied materials for tympanic membrane repair. The paper begins with an introduction of the physiological structure of the tympanic membrane, briefly reviews the current clinical method thereafter, highlights the recent 3D printing-related strategies in tympanic membrane repair, describes the materials and cells that might play an important role in 3D printing, and finally provides a perspective of this field.	3D printing technology and applied materials in eardrum regeneration.	2023	May	Hu Haolei;Chen Jianwei;Li Shuo;Xu Tao;Li Yi	3d printing;Tympanic membrane perforation;eardrum regeneration;materials; stem cells	Humans;Tympanic Membrane;Quality of Life;Tympanic Membrane Perforation;Printing, Three-Dimensional;Regeneration	Journal of biomaterials science.

36305041	Hydrogels hold much promise for 3D printing of functional living materials; however, challenges remain in tailoring mechanical robustness as well as biological performance. In addressing this challenge, the modular synthesis of functional hydrogels from 3-arm diblock copolypeptide stars composed of an inner poly(l-glutamate) domain and outer poly(l-tyrosine) or poly(l-valine) blocks is described. Physical crosslinking due to ß-sheet assembly of these star block copolymers gives mechanical stability during extrusion printing and the selective incorporation of methacrylate units allows for subsequent photocrosslinking to occur under biocompatible conditions. This permits direct ink writing (DIW) printing of bacteria-based mixtures leading to 3D objects with high fidelity and excellent bacterial viability. The tunable stiffness of different copolypeptide networks enables control over proliferation and colony formation for embedded Escherichia coli bacteria as demonstrated via isopropyl ß-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) induction of green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression. This translation of molecular structure to network properties highlights the versatility of these polypeptide hydrogel systems with the combination of writable structures and biological activity illustrating the future potential of these 3D-printed biocomposites.

36055612	"Osteochondral tissue has a complex hierarchical structure spanning subchondral bone to articular cartilage. Biomaterials approaches to mimic and repair these interfaces have had limited success, largely due to challenges in fabricating composite hard-soft interfaces with living cells. Biofabrication approaches have emerged as attractive methods to form osteochondral analogues through additive assembly of hard and soft components. We have developed a unique printing platform that is able to integrate soft and hard materials concurrently through freeform printing of mineralized constructs within tunable microgel suspensions containing living cells. A library of microgels based on gelatin were prepared, where the stiffness of the microgels and a liquid ""filler"" phase can be tuned for bioprinting while simultaneously directing differentiation. Tuning microgel stiffness and filler content differentially directs chondrogenesis and osteogenesis within the same construct, demonstrating how this technique can be used to fabricate osteochondral interfaces in a single step. Printing of a rapidly setting calcium phosphate cement, so called ""bone-ink"" within a cell laden suspension bath further guides differentiation, where the cells adjacent to the nucleated hydroxyapatite phase undergo osteogenesis with cells in the surrounding medium undergoing chondrogenesis. In this way, bone analogues with hierarchical structure can be formed within cell-laden gradient soft matrices to yield multiphasic osteochondral constructs. This technique provides a versatile one-pot biofabrication approach without harsh post-processing which will aid efforts in bone disease modelling and tissue engineering. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: This paper demonstrates the first example of a biofabrication approach to rapidly form osteochondral constructs in a single step under physiological conditions. Key to this advance is a tunable suspension of extracellular matrix microgels that are packed together with stem cells, providing a unique and modular scaffolding for guiding the simultaneous formation of bone and cartilage tissue. The physical properties of the suspension allow direct writing of a ceramic ""bone-ink"", resulting in an ordered structure of microscale hydrogels, living cells, and bone mimics in a single step. This platform reveals a simple approach to making complex skeletal tissue for disease modelling, with the possibility of repairing and replacing bone-cartilage interfaces in the clinic using a patient's own cells."

36041651	The development of tissue engineering strategies for treatment of large bone defects has become increasingly relevant, given the growing demand for bone substitutes. Native bone is composed of a dense vascular network necessary for the regulation of bone development, regeneration and homeostasis. A major obstacle in fabricating living, clinically relevant-sized bone mimics (1-10 cm3) is the limited supply of nutrients, including oxygen to the core of the construct. Therefore, strategies to support vascularization are pivotal for the development of tissue engineered bone constructs. Creating a functional bone construct integrated with a vascular network, capable of delivering the necessary nutrients for optimal tissue development is imperative for translation into the clinics. The vascular system is composed of a complex network that runs throughout the body in a tree-like hierarchical branching fashion. A significant challenge for tissue engineering approaches lies in mimicking the intricate, multi-scale structures consisting of larger vessels (macro-vessels) which interconnect with multiple sprouting vessels (microvessels) in a closed network. The advent of biofabrication has enabled complex, out of plane channels to be generated and has laid the groundwork for the creation of multi-scale vasculature in recent years. This review highlights the key state-of-the-art achievements for the development of vascular networks of varying scales in the field of biofabrication with a particular focus for its application in developing a functional tissue engineered bone construct. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: There is a growing need for bone substitutes to overcome the limited supply of patient-derived bone. Bone tissue engineering aims to overcome this by combining stem cells with scaffolds to restore missing bone. The current bottleneck in upscaling is the lack of an integrated vascular network, required for the delivery of nutrients to cells. 3D bioprinting techniques has enabled the creation of complex hollow structures of varying dimensions that resemble native blood vessels. The convergence of multiple materials, cell types and fabrication approaches, opens the possibility of developing clinically-relevant sized vascularized bone constructs. This review provides an up-to-date insight of the technologies currently available for the generation of complex vascular networks, with a focus on their application in bone tissue engineering.

36017861	Among the different approaches present in regenerative medicine and tissue engineering, the one that has attracted the most interest in recent years is the possibility of printing functional biological tissues. Bioprinting is a technique that has been applied to create cellularized three-dimensional structures that mimic biological tissues and thus allow their replacement. Hydrogels are interesting materials for this type of technique. Hydrogels based on natural polymers are known due to their biocompatible properties, in addition to being attractive biomaterials for cell encapsulation. They provide a threedimensional aqueous environment with biologically relevant chemical and physical signals, mimicking the natural environment of the extracellular matrix (ECM). Bioinks are ink formulations that allow the printing of living cells. The controlled deposition of biomaterials by bioinks needs to maintain cell viability and offer specific biochemical and physical stimuli capable of guiding cell migration, proliferation, and differentiation. In this work, we analyze the theoretical and practical issues of bioprinting, citing currently used methods, their advantages, and limitations. We present some important molecules that have been used to compose bioinks, as well as the cellular responses that have been observed in different tissues. Finally, we indicate future perspectives of the method.

35853599	Ubiquitous in embryonic development, tissue fusion is of interest to tissue engineers who use tissue spheroids or organoids as building blocks of three-dimensional (3D) multicellular constructs. This review presents mathematical models and computer simulations of the fusion of tissue spheroids. The motivation of this study stems from the need to predict the post-printing evolution of 3D bioprinted constructs. First, we provide a brief overview of differential adhesion, the main morphogenetic mechanism involved in post-printing structure formation. It will be shown that clusters of cohesive cells behave as an incompressible viscous fluid on the time scale of hours. The discussion turns then to mathematical models based on the continuum hydrodynamics of highly viscous liquids and on statistical mechanics. Next, we analyze the validity and practical use of computational models of multicellular self-assembly in live constructs created by tissue spheroid bioprinting. Finally, we discuss the perspectives of the field as machine learning starts to reshape experimental design, and modular robotic workstations tend to alleviate the burden of repetitive tasks in biofabrication. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Bioprinted constructs are living systems, which evolve via morphogenetic mechanisms known from developmental biology. This review presents mathematical and computational tools devised for modeling post-printing structure formation. They help achieving a desirable outcome without expensive optimization experiments. While previous reviews mainly focused on assumptions, technical details, strengths, and limitations of computational models of multicellular self-assembly, this article discusses their validity and practical use in biofabrication. It also presents an overview of mathematical models that proved to be useful in the evaluation of experimental data on tissue spheroid fusion, and in the calibration of computational models. Finally, the perspectives of the field are discussed in the advent of robotic biofabrication platforms and bioprinting process optimization by machine learning.

35574057	Fabrication of functional scaffolds for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine applications requires material systems with precise control over cellular performance. 3D printing is a powerful technique to create highly complex and multicomponent structures with well-defined architecture and composition. In this review paper, we explore extrusion-based 3D printing methods (EBP, i.e., Near Field Electrospinning (NFES), Melt Electrowriting (MEW), Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM), and extrusion bioprinting) in terms of their ability to produce scaffolds with bio-instructive properties. These material systems provide spatio-temporal guidance for cells, allowing controlled tissue regeneration and maturation. Multiple physical and biochemical cues introduced to the EBP scaffolds are evaluated in their ability to direct cell alignment, proliferation, differentiation, specific ECM production, and tissue maturation. We indicate that the cues have different impacts depending on the material system, cell type used, or coexistence of multiple cues. Therefore, they must be carefully chosen based on the targeted application. We propose future directions in bio-instructive materials development, including such concepts as metamaterials, hybrid living materials, and 4D printing. The review gathers the knowledge essential for designing new materials with a controlled cellular response, fabrication of advanced engineered tissue, and developing a better understanding of cell biology, especially in response to the biomaterial.	3D printing of bio-instructive materials: Toward directing the cell.	2023	Jan	Zieliński Piotr Stanisław;Gudeti Pavan Kumar Reddy;Rikmanspoel Timo;Włodarczyk-Biegun Małgorzata Katarzyna	3D scaffold;Additive manufacturing;Biomaterials;Cell differentiation;Melt electrowriting;Tissue engineering		Bioactive materials	Polymer Science, Zernike Institute for Advanced Materials, University of Groningen, Nijenborgh 4, 9747 AG, Groningen, the Netherlands.;Biotechnology Centre, The Silesian University of Technology, B.

33882674	Additive manufacturing technologies have progressed in the past decades, especially when used to print biofunctional structures such as scaffolds and vessels with living cells for tissue engineering applications. Part quality and reliability are essential to maintaining the biocompatibility and structural integrity needed for engineered tissue constructs. As a result, it is critical to detect for any anomalies that may occur in the 3D-bioprinting process that can cause a mismatch between the desired designs and printed shapes. However, challenges exist in detecting the imperfections within oftentimes transparent bioprinted and complex printing features accurately and efficiently. In this study, an anomaly detection system based on layer-by-layer sensor images and machine learning algorithms is developed to distinguish and classify imperfections for transparent hydrogel-based bioprinted materials. High anomaly detection accuracy is obtained by utilizing convolutional neural network methods as well as advanced image processing and augmentation techniques on extracted small image patches. Along with the prediction of various anomalies, the category of infill pattern and location information on the image patches can be accurately determined. It is envisioned that using our detection system to categorize and localize printing anomalies, real-time autonomous correction of process parameters can be realized to achieve high-quality tissue constructs in 3D-bioprinting processes.

38749490	Today, humidity sensors have become an integral part of our daily lives. In particular, humidity sensors using an electronic measuring principle have become the standard. Although these sensors have proven to be a stable measurement method, they have some disadvantages, such as their long response time or the danger of using them in explosive environments. This paper introduces photonic crystals as an alternative optical measurement approach. We combined the novel technology of ultra-fast two-photon polymerisation printing with a thin-film deposition process, namely iCVD. This allowed us to print large area high-precision 3D templates, which were subsequently coated with a humidity responsive hydrogel thin film (pHEMA) of 20 nm. We were also able to push the limits of 2PP technology and still produce stable and periodic large-area 3D structures. The flexible customization of hydrogels for ambient conditions make them exceptionally promising for a wide range of sensing applications. Additionally, optical methods for measuring humidity seem to be an excellent alternative to overcome the limitations for current state of the art humidity sensors. The optical detection of changes in ambient air humidity was achieved by observing color changes of the printed structure within the visible wavelength range. This article is protected by copyright.

38732742	This study investigates the interaction between static and fatigue strength and the rheological properties of acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS) polymer reinforced with graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) in both filament and 3D-printed forms. Specifically focusing on the effects of 1.0 wt.% GNPs, the study examines their influence on static/fatigue responses. The rheological behaviour of pure ABS polymer and ABS/GNPs nanocomposite samples, fabricated through material extrusion, is evaluated. The results indicated that the addition of 1.0 wt.% GNPs to the ABS matrix improved the elastic modulus of the nanocomposite filaments by up to about 34%, while reducing their ductility by approximately 60%. Observations revealed that the static and fatigue responses of the composite filament materials and 3D-printed parts were not solely attributed to differences in mechanical properties, but were also influenced by extrusion-related process parameters. The shark-skin effect, directly related to the material's rheological properties, had a major impact on static strength and fatigue life. The proposed method involved adjusting the temperature of the heating zones of the extruder during filament production to enhance the static response of the filament and using a higher nozzle temperature (270 °C) to improve the fatigue life of the 3D-printed samples. The findings reveal that the proposed parameter optimisation led to filaments with minimised shark-skin effects, resulting in an improvement in ultimate tensile strength compared to pure ABS. Moreover, the 3D-printed samples produced with a higher nozzle temperature exhibited increased fatigue lives compared to those manufactured under identical conditions as pure ABS.

Currently, in the field of regenerative medicine, we are working toward obtaining approval from the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare and commercializing large artificial organs that are made from patients' own cells and have functions such as nerve regeneration, osteochondral regeneration, and blood vessels. On the other hand, this three-dimensional cell stacking technology can be extended to technology for culturing cells in an environment similar to the human body, and is expected to serve as a new methodology for evaluating the effects of new products in various fields on living organisms. Therefore, we are planning a business to provide developers of pharmaceuticals, foods, cosmetics, etc. with a small device called ""Functional Cell Device (FCD)"" that reproduces some of the functions of human organs outside the body.

38674954	Nowadays, due to water pollution, more and more living beings are exposed to dangerous compounds, which can lead to them contracting diseases. The removal of contaminants (including heavy metals) from water is, therefore, a necessary aspect to guarantee the well-being of living beings. Among the most used techniques, the employment of adsorbent materials is certainly advantageous, as they are easy to synthesize and are cheap. In this work, poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA) hydrogels doped with silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) for removing Hg(II) ions from water are presented. AgNPs were embedded in PEGDA-based matrices by using a photo-polymerizable solution. By exploiting a custom-made 3D printer, the filters were synthesized. The kinetics of interaction was studied, revealing that the adsorption equilibrium is achieved in 8 h. Subsequently, the adsorption isotherms of PEGDA doped with AgNPs towards Hg(II) ions were studied at different temperatures (4 °C, 25 °C, and 50 °C). In all cases, the best isotherm model was the Langmuir one (revealing that the chemisorption is the driving process and the most favorable one), with maximum adsorption capacities equal to 0.55, 0.57, and 0.61 mg/g, respectively. Finally, the removal efficiency was evaluated for the three temperatures, obtaining for 4 °C, 25 °C, and 50 °C the values 94%, 94%, and 86%, respectively.

38651321	3D printing of a living bioanode holds the potential for the rapid and efficient production of bioelectrochemistry systems. However, the ink (such as sodium alginate, SA) that formed the matrix of the 3D-printed bioanode may hinder extracellular electron transfer (EET) between the microorganism and conductive materials. Here, we proposed a biomimetic design of a 3D-printed Shewanella bioanode, wherein riboflavin (RF) was modified on carbon black (CB) to serve as a redox substance for microbial EET. By introducing the medicated EET pathways, the 3D-printed bioanode obtained a maximum power density of 252 ± 12 mW/m2, which was 1.7 and 60.5 times higher than those of SA-CB (92 ± 10 mW/m2) and a bare carbon cloth anode (3.8 ± 0.4 mW/m2). Adding RF reduced the charge-transfer resistance of a 3D-printed bioanode by 75% (189.5 ± 18.7 vs 47.3 ± 7.8 Ω), indicating a significant acceleration in the EET efficiency within the bioanode. This work provided a fundamental and instrumental concept for constructing a 3D-printed bioanode.

38648508	Engineered living structures with the incorporation of functional bacteria have been explored extensively in recent years and have shown promising potential applications in biosensing, environmental remediation, and biomedicine. However, it is still rare and challenging to achieve multifunctional capabilities such as material production, shape transformation, and sensing in a single-engineered living structure. In this study, we demonstrate bifunctional living structures by synergistically integrating cellulose-generating bacteria with pH-responsive hydrogels, and the entire structures can be precisely fabricated by three-dimensional (3D) printing. Such 3D-printed bifunctional living structures produce cellulose nanofibers in ambient conditions and have reversible and controlled shape-morphing properties (usually referred to as four-dimensional printing). Those functionalities make them biomimetic versions of silkworms in the sense that both can generate nanofibers and have body motion. We systematically investigate the processing-structure-property relationship of the bifunctional living structures. The on-demand separation of 3D cellulose structures from the hydrogel template and the living nature of the bacteria after processing and shape transformation are also demonstrated.

This strategy enabled the rapid manufacturing of a library of polyurethane-based elastomeric materials with differentiated thermal and mechanical properties. The automated semicontinuous batch synthesis approach proved enabling for resins with otherwise short shelf lives because of the intimate connection between synthesis, formulation, and processing.

38522274	Plastics are a wide range of synthetic or semi-synthetic materials, mainly consisting of polymers. The use of plastics has increased to over 300 million metric tonnes in recent years, and by 2050, it is expected to grow to 800 million. Presently, a mere 10% of plastic waste is recycled, with approximately 75% ended up in landfills. Inappropriate disposal of plastic waste into the environment poses a threat to human lives and marine species. Therefore, this review article highlights potential routes for converting plastic/microplastic waste into valuable resources to promote a greener and more sustainable environment. The literature review revealed that plastics/microplastics (P/MP) could be recycled or upcycled into various products or materials via several innovative processes. For example, P/MP are recycled and utilized as anodes in lithium-ion (Li-ion) and sodium-ion (Na-ion) batteries. The anode in Na-ion batteries comprising PP carbon powder exhibits a high reversible capacity of ∼340 mAh/g at 0.01 A/g current state. In contrast, integrating Fe3O4 and PE into a Li-ion battery yielded an excellent capacity of 1123 mAh/g at 0.5 A/g current state. Additionally, recycled Nylon displayed high physical and mechanical properties necessary for excellent application as 3D printing material. Induction heating is considered a revolutionary pyrolysis technique with improved yield, efficiency, and lower energy utilization. Overall, P/MPs are highlighted as abundant resources for the sustainable production of valuable products and materials such as batteries, nanomaterials, graphene, and membranes for future applications.

38507816	Tissue engineering for injured tissue replacement and regeneration has been a subject of investigation over the last 30 years, and there has been considerable interest in using additive manufacturing to achieve these goals. Despite such efforts, many key questions remain unanswered, particularly in the area of biomaterial selection for these applications as well as quantitative understanding of the process science. The strategic utilization of biological macromolecules provides a versatile approach to meet diverse requirements in 3D printing, such as printability, buildability, and biocompatibility. These molecules play a pivotal role in both physical and chemical cross-linking processes throughout the biofabrication, contributing significantly to the overall success of the 3D printing process. Among the several bioprintable materials, gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) has been widely utilized for diverse tissue engineering applications, with some degree of success. In this context, this review will discuss the key bioengineering approaches to identify the gelation and cross-linking strategies that are appropriate to control the rheology, printability, and buildability of biomaterial inks. This review will focus on the GelMA as the structural (scaffold) biomaterial for different tissues and as a potential carrier vehicle for the transport of living cells as well as their maintenance and viability in the physiological system. Recognizing the importance of printability toward shape fidelity and biophysical properties, a major focus in this review has been to discuss the qualitative and quantitative impact of the key factors, including microrheological, viscoelastic, gelation, shear thinning properties of biomaterial inks, and printing parameters, in particular, reference to 3D extrusion printing of GelMA-based biomaterial inks. Specifically, we emphasize the different possibilities to regulate mechanical, swelling, biodegradation, and cellular functionalities of GelMA-based bio(material) inks, by hybridization techniques, including different synthetic and natural biopolymers, inorganic nanofillers, and microcarriers. At the close, the potential possibility of the integration of experimental data sets and artificial intelligence/machine learning approaches is emphasized to predict the printability, shape fidelity, or biophysical properties of GelMA bio(material) inks for clinically relevant tissues.

This process provided cell fabrication containing 108 cells/mL, embedded multiple cell populations in one structure, and enabled millimeter-sized scaleup.

38476775	"A wide range of emerging biomedical applications and clinical interventions rely on the ability to deliver living cells via hollow, high-aspect-ratio microneedles. Recently, microneedle arrays (MNA) have gained increasing interest due to inherent benefits for drug delivery; however, studies exploring the potential to harness such advantages for cell delivery have been impeded due to the difficulties in manufacturing high-aspect-ratio MNAs suitable for delivering mammalian cells. To bypass these challenges, here we leverage and extend our previously reported hybrid additive manufacturing (or ""three-dimensional (3D) printing) strategy-i.e., the combined the ""Vat Photopolymerization (VPP)"" technique, ""Liquid Crystal Display (LCD)"" 3D printing with ""Two-Photon Direct Laser Writing (DLW)""-to 3D print hollow MNAs that are suitable for cell delivery investigations. Specifically, we 3D printed four sets of 650 μm-tall MNAs corresponding to needle-specific inner diameters (IDs) of 25 μm, 50 μm, 75 μm, and 100 μm, and then examined the effects of these MNAs on the post-delivery viability of both dendritic cells (DCs) and HEK293 cells. Experimental results revealed that the 25 μm-ID case led to a statistically significant reduction in post-MNA-delivery cell viability for both cell types; however, MNAs with needle-specific IDs ≥ 50 μm were statistically indistinguishable from one another as well as conventional 32G single needles, thereby providing an important benchmark for MNA-mediated cell delivery."

38475293	Surface wrinkling provides an approach to fabricate micron and sub-micron-level biomaterial topographies that can mimic features of the dynamic, in vivo cell environment and guide cell adhesion, alignment, and differentiation. Most wrinkling research to date has used planar, two-dimensional (2D) substrates, and wrinkling work on three-dimensional (3D) structures has been limited. To enable wrinkle formation on architecturally complex, biomimetic 3D structures, here, we report a simple, low-cost experimental wrinkling approach that combines natural silk fibroin films with a recently developed advanced manufacturing technique for programming strain in complex 3D shape-memory polymer (SMP) scaffolds. By systematically investigating the influence of SMP programmed strain magnitude, silk film thickness, and aqueous media on wrinkle morphology and stability, we reveal how to generate and tune silk wrinkles on the micron and sub-micron scale. We find that increasing SMP programmed strain magnitude increases wavelength and decreases amplitudes of silk wrinkled topographies, while increasing silk film thickness increases wavelength and amplitude. Silk wrinkles persist after 24 h in cell culture medium. Wrinkled topographies demonstrate high cell viability and attachment. These findings suggest the potential for fabricating biomimetic cellular microenvironments that can advance understanding and control of cell-material interactions in engineering tissue constructs.

38444974	Droplet-based microfluidics systems have become widely used in recent years thanks to their advantages, varying from the possibility of handling small fluid volumes to directly synthesizing and encapsulating various living forms for biological-related applications. The effectiveness of such systems mainly depends on the ability to control some of these systems' parameters, such as produced droplet size and formation time, which represents a challenging task. This work reports an experimental study on tuning droplet size and generation time in a flow-focusing geometry fabricated with stereolithography 3D printing by exploring the interplay of phase and geometrical parameters. We produced droplets at different low flow rates of continuous and dispersed phases to assess the effect of each of these phases on the droplets' size and formation time. We observed that smaller droplets were produced for high viscosity oil and water phase, along with high flow rates. In addition, changing the microfluidics channels' width, and morphology of the orifice has shown a similar effect on droplet size, as shown in the case of high-viscosity solutions. The variation of the bifurcation angle shows a noticeable variation in terms of the achieved droplet size and formation time. We further investigated the impact of modifying the width ratio of the continuous and dispersed phases on droplet formation.	3D printing in microfluidics: experimental optimization of droplet size and generation time through flow focusing, phase, and geometry variation.	2024	Feb	Britel Adam;Tomagra Giulia;Aprà Pietro;Varzi Veronica;Sturari Sofia;Amine Nour-Hanne;Olivero Paolo;Picollo Federico			RSC advances	"Department of Physics, ""NIS"" Inter-departmental Centre, University of Torino, National Institute of Nuclear Physics Sect.

38435469	The pressing need for multifunctional materials in medical settings encompasses a wide array of scenarios, necessitating specific tissue functionalities. A critical challenge is the occurrence of biofouling, particularly by contamination in surgical environments, a common cause of scaffolds impairment. Beyond the imperative to avoid infections, it is also essential to integrate scaffolds with living cells to allow for tissue regeneration, mediated by cell attachment. Here, we focus on the development of a versatile material for medical applications, driven by the diverse time-definite events after scaffold implantation. We investigate the potential of incorporating graphene oxide (GO) into polycaprolactone (PCL) and create a composite for 3D printing a scaffold with time-controlled antibacterial and anti-adhesive growth properties. Indeed, the as-produced PCL-GO scaffold displays a local hydrophobic effect, which is translated into a limitation of biological entities-attachment, including a diminished adhesion of bacteriophages and a reduction of E. coli and S. aureus adhesion of ∼81% and ∼69%, respectively. Moreover, the ability to 3D print PCL-GO scaffolds with different heights enables control over cell distribution and attachment, a feature that can be also exploited for cellular confinement, i.e., for microfluidics or wound healing applications. With time, the surface wettability increases, and the scaffold can be populated by cells. Finally, the presence of GO allows for the use of infrared light for the sterilization of scaffolds and the disruption of any bacteria cell that might adhere to the more hydrophilic surface. Overall, our results showcase the potential of PCL-GO as a versatile material for medical applications.

38393601	Embedded extrusion 3D bioprinting is a rapidly emerging additive manufacturing methodology that provides a precise spatial deposition of synthetic or natural-origin low-viscosity bioinks during the extrusion printing process. Such a strategy has to date unlocked the freeform extrusion biofabrication of complex micro-to-macro-scale living architectures for numerous applications, including tissue engineering and in vitro disease modeling. In this chapter, we describe a suspension bioprinting methodology leveraging a continuous viscoelastic biopolymer supporting bath functionalized with divalent calcium cations to enable a rapid processing of user-defined bioinks toward architecturally complex 3D in vitro tumor models. This highly simple and cost-effective viscoelastic supporting bath enables a full freeform biofabrication of cell-laden 3D tumor-mimetic architectures that exhibit structural stability in culture post-printing. The cytocompatibility of the supporting bath, its ease of removal from biofabricated living constructs, and its adaptability for processing different ECM-mimetic bioinks open avenues for multi-scale fabrication of numerous types of physiomimetic 3D tumor models for preclinical screening of candidate therapeutics.

38389497	Hydrogels possess unique features such as softness, wetness, responsiveness, and biocompatibility, making them highly suitable for biointegrated applications that have close interactions with living organisms. However, conventional man-made hydrogels are usually soft and brittle, making them inferior to the mechanically robust biological hydrogels. To ensure reliable and durable operation of biointegrated wearable and implantable devices, mechanical matching and shape adaptivity of hydrogels to tissues and organs are essential. Recent advances in polymer science and processing technologies have enabled mechanical engineering and shaping of hydrogels for various biointegrated applications. In this review, polymer network structuring strategies at micro/nanoscales for toughening hydrogels are summarized, and representative mechanical functionalities that exist in biological materials but are not easily achieved in synthetic hydrogels are further discussed. Three categories of processing technologies, namely, 3D printing, spinning, and coating for fabrication of tough hydrogel constructs with complex shapes are reviewed, and the corresponding hydrogel toughening strategies are also highlighted. These developments enable adaptive fabrication of mechanically robust and functional hydrogel devices, and promote application of hydrogels in the fields of biomedical engineering, bioelectronics, and soft robotics.

38383670	Self-monitoring materials have promising applications in structural health monitoring. However, developing organic afterglow materials for self-monitoring is a highly intriguing yet challenging task. Herein, we design two organic molecules with a twisted donor-acceptor-acceptor' configuration and achieve dual-emissive afterglow with tunable lifetimes (86.1-287.7 ms) by doping into various matrices. Based on a photosensitive resin, a series of complex structures are prepared using 3D printing technology. They exhibit tunable afterglow lifetime and Young's Modulus by manipulating the photocuring time and humidity level. With sufficient photocuring or in dry conditions, a long-lived bright green afterglow without apparent deformation under external loading is realized. We demonstrate that the mechanical properties of complex 3D printing structures can be well monitored by controlling the photocuring time and humidity, and quantitively manifested by afterglow lifetimes.

38368095	Anisotropic structures exist in almost all living organisms to endow them with superior properties and physiological functionalities. However, conventional artificial materials possess unordered isotropic structures, resulting in limited functions and applications. The development of anisotropic structures on carbohydrates is reported to have an impact on their properties and applications. In this review, various alignment strategies for carbohydrates (i.e., cellulose, chitin and alginate) from bottom-up to top-down strategies are discussed, including the rapidly developed innovative technologies such as shear-induced orientation through extrusion-based 3D/4D printing, magnetic-assisted alignment, and electric-induced alignment. The unique properties and wide applications of anisotropic carbohydrate materials across different fields, from biomedical, biosensors, smart actuators, soft conductive materials, to thermal management are also summarized. Finally, recommendations on the selection of fabrication strategies are given. The major challenge lies in the construction of long-range hierarchical alignment with high orientation degree and precise control over complicated architectures. With the future development of hierarchical alignment strategies, alignment control techniques, and alignment mechanism elucidation, the potential of anisotropic carbohydrate materials for scalable manufacture and clinical applications will be fully realized.

38324892	Despite significant advances in the management of patients with oral cancer, maxillofacial reconstruction after ablative surgery remains a clinical challenge. In bone tissue engineering, biofabrication strategies have been proposed as promising alternatives to solve issues associated with current therapies and to produce bone substitutes that mimic both the structure and function of native bone. Among them, laser-assisted bioprinting (LAB) has emerged as a relevant biofabrication method to print living cells and biomaterials with micrometric resolution onto a receiving substrate, also called 'biopaper'. Recent studies have demonstrated the benefits of prevascularization using LAB to promote vascularization and bone regeneration, but mechanical and biological optimization of the biopaper are needed. The aim of this study was to apply gelatin-sheet fabrication process to the development of a novel biopaper able to support prevascularization organized by LAB for bone tissue engineering applications. Gelatin-based sheets incorporating bioactive glasses (BGs) were produced using various freezing methods and crosslinking (CL) parameters. The different formulations were characterized in terms of microstructural, physical, mechanical, and biological properties in monoculture and coculture. Based on multi-criteria analysis, a rank scoring method was used to identify the most relevant formulations. The selected biopaper underwent additional characterization regarding its ability to support mineralization and vasculogenesis, its bioactivity potential andin vivodegradability. The biopaper 'Gel5wt% BG1wt%-slow freezing-CL160 °C 24 h' was selected as the best candidate, due to its suitable properties including high porosity (91.69 ± 1.55%), swelling ratio (91.61 ± 0.60%), Young modulus (3.97 × 104± 0.97 × 104Pa) but also its great cytocompatibility, osteogenesis and bioactivity properties. The preorganization of human umbilical vein endothelial cell using LAB onto this new biopaper led to the formation of microvascular networks.

38319966	Stinger-like structures in living organisms evolved convergently across taxa for both defensive and offensive purposes, with the main goal being penetration and damage. Our observations over a broad range of taxa and sizes, from microscopic radiolarians to narwhals, reveal a self-similar geometry of the stinger extremity: the diameter (d) increases along the distance from the tip (x) following a power law [Formula: see text] , with the tapering exponent varying universally between 2 and 3. We demonstrate, through analytical and experimental mechanics involving three-dimensional (3D) printing, that this geometry optimizes the stinger's performance; it represents a trade-off between the propensity to buckle, for n smaller than 2, and increased penetration force, for n greater than 3. Moreover, we find that this optimal tapering exponent does not depend on stinger size and aspect ratio (base diameter over length). We conclude that for Nature's stingers, composed of biological materials with moduli ranging from hundreds of megapascals to ten gigapascals, the necessity for a power-law contour increases with sharpness to ensure sufficient stability for penetration of skin-like tissues. Our results offer a solution to the puzzle underlying this universal geometric trait of biological stingers and may provide a new strategy to design needle-like structures for engineering or medical applications.

38295083	Smart hydrogels are a promising candidate for the development of next-generation soft materials due to their stimuli-responsiveness, deformability, and biocompatibility. However, it remains challenging to enable hydrogels to actively adapt to various environmental conditions like living organisms. In this work, supramolecular additives are introduced to the hydrogel matrix to confer environmental adaptiveness. Specifically, their microstructures, swelling behaviors, mechanical properties, and transparency can adapt to external environmental conditions. Moreover, the presence of hydrogen bonding provides the hydrogel with applicable rheological properties for 3D extrusion printing, thus allowing for the facile preparation of thickness-dependent camouflage and multistimuli responsive complex. The environmentally adaptive hydrogel developed in this study offers new approaches for manipulating supramolecular interactions and broadens the capability of smart hydrogels in information security and multifunctional integrated actuation.	3D Printable Active Hydrogels with Supramolecular Additive-Driven Adaptiveness.	2024	Jan	Li Xiao;Guan Zhecun;Zhao Jiayu;Bae Jinhye	3D printing;smart hydrogels;soft actuators;stimuli-responsive hydrogels;supramolecular interactions		Small (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)	Materials Science & Engineering Program, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, 92093, USA.;Department of NanoEngineering, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, 92093, USA.;Department of NanoEngineering, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, 92093, USA.;Materials Science & Engineering Program, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, 92093, USA.;Department of NanoEngineering, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, 92093, USA.;Chemical Engineering Program, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, 92093, USA.

38277695	Artificial cells are engineered units with cell-like functions for different purposes including acting as supportive elements for mammalian cells. Artificial cells with minimal liver-like function are made of alginate and equipped with metalloporphyrins that mimic the enzyme activity of a member of the cytochrome P450 family namely CYP1A2. The artificial cells are employed to enhance the dealkylation activity within 3D bioprinted structures composed of HepG2 cells and these artificial cells. This enhancement is monitored through the conversion of resorufin ethyl ether to resorufin. HepG2 cell aggregates are 3D bioprinted using an alginate/gelatin methacryloyl ink, resulting in the successful proliferation of the HepG2 cells. The composite ink made of an alginate/gelatin liquid phase with an increasing amount of artificial cells is characterized. The CYP1A2-like activity of artificial cells is preserved over at least 35 days, where 6 nM resorufin is produced in 8 h. Composite inks made of artificial cells and HepG2 cell aggregates in a liquid phase are used for 3D bioprinting. The HepG2 cells proliferate over 35 days, and the structure has boosted CYP1A2 activity. The integration of artificial cells and their living counterparts into larger 3D semi-synthetic tissues is a step towards exploring bottom-up synthetic biology in tissue engineering.

38271574	The aim of this study was to assess the bone regeneration potential of a polydioxanone (PDO) scaffold together with recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2 (rhBMP-2) for the reconstruction of large bone defect. In total, 24 male rats (6 months old) were subjected to bilateral femoral stabilization using titanium plates to create a 2 mm gap, and reconstruction using rhBMP-2 (Infuse®; 3.25 μg). The bone defects were covered with PDO (PDO group), or with titanium mesh (Ti group). Animals were euthanized on days 14 and 60. Simultaneously, 16 rats received PDO and Ti in their dorsum for the purpose of biocompatibility analysis at 3, 5, 7, and 10 days postoperatively. X-ray densitometry showed a higher density in the PDO group on day 14. On day 60, coverage of the bone defect with PDO showed a larger quantity of newly formed bone than that found for the Ti group, a lower inflammatory infiltrate value, and a more significant number of blood vessels on day 14. By immunohistochemical assessment, runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) and osteocalcin (OCN) showed higher labeling on day 14 in the PDO group. On day 60, bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) showed higher labeling in the PDO group, whereas Ti showed higher labeling for osteoprotegerin, nuclear factor kappa B ligand-activating receptor, RUNX2, and OCN. Furthermore, biocompatibility analysis showed a higher inflammatory response in the Ti group. The PDO scaffold enhanced bone regeneration when associated with rhBMP-2 in rat femur reconstruction. Impact statement Regeneration of segmental bone defects is a difficult task, and several techniques and materials have been used. Recent advances in the production of synthetic polymers, such as polydioxanone (PDO), produced by three-dimensional printing, have shown distinct characteristics that could improve tissue regeneration even in an important bone defect. The present preclinical study showed that PDO membranes used as scaffolds to carry recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2 (rhBMP-2) improved bone tissue regeneration by more than 8-fold when compared with titanium mesh, suggesting that PDO membranes could be a feasible and useful material for use in guided bone regeneration.

38265427	Liquid structures of thin-films and torus droplets are omnipresent in daily lives. The morphological evolution of liquid structures suspending in another immiscible fluid and sitting on a solid substrate is investigated by using three-dimensional (3D) phase-field (PF) simulations. Here, we address the evolution dynamics by scrutinizing the interplay of surface energy, kinetic energy, and viscous dissipation, which is characterized by Reynolds number Re and Weber number We. We observe special droplet breakup phenomena by varying Re and We. In addition, we gain the essential physical insights into controlling the droplet formation resulting from the morphological evolution of the liquid structures by characterizing the top and side profiles under different circumstances. We find that the shape evolution of the liquid structures is intimately related to the initial shape, Re, We as well as the intrinsic wettability of the substrate. Furthermore, it is revealed that the evolution dynamics are determined by the competition between the coalescence phenomenology and the hydrodynamic instability of the liquid structures. For the coalescence phenomenology, the liquid structure merges onto itself, while the hydrodynamic instability leads to the breakup of the liquid structure. Last but not least, we investigate the influence of wall relaxation on the breakup outcome of torus droplets on substrates with different contact angles. We shed light on how the key parameters including the initial shape, Re, We, wettability, and wall relaxation influence the droplet dynamics and droplet formation. These findings are anticipated to contribute insights into droplet-based systems, potentially impacting areas like ink-jet printing, drug delivery systems, and microfluidic devices, where the interplay of surface energy, kinetic energy, and viscous dissipation plays a crucial role.

38240370	Planar microelectrode arrays (MEAs) for - in vitro or in vivo - neuronal signal recordings lack the spatial resolution and sufficient signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) required for a detailed understanding of neural network function and synaptic plasticity. To overcome these limitations, a highly customizable three-dimensional (3D) printing process is used in combination with thin film technology and a self-aligned template-assisted electrochemical deposition process to fabricate 3D-printed-based MEAs on stiff or flexible substrates. Devices with design flexibility and physical robustness are shown for recording neural activity in different in vitro and in vivo applications, achieving high-aspect ratio 3D microelectrodes of up to 33:1. Here, MEAs successfully record neural activity in 3D neuronal cultures, retinal explants, and the cortex of living mice, thereby demonstrating the versatility of the 3D MEA while maintaining high-quality neural recordings. Customizable 3D MEAs provide unique opportunities to study neural activity under regular or various pathological conditions, both in vitro and in vivo, and contribute to the development of drug screening and neuromodulation systems that can accurately monitor the activity of large neural networks over time.

38211501	Tissue engineering is a fascinating field that combines biology, engineering, and medicine to create artificial tissues and organs. It involves using living cells, biomaterials, and bioengineering techniques to develop functional tissues that can be used to replace or repair damaged or diseased organs in the human body. The process typically starts by obtaining cells from the patient or a donor. These cells are then cultured and grown in a laboratory under controlled conditions. Scaffold materials, such as biodegradable polymers or natural extracellular matrices, are used to provide support and structure for the growing cells. 3D bone scaffolds are a fascinating application within the field of tissue engineering. These scaffolds are designed to mimic the structure and properties of natural bone tissue and serve as a temporary framework for new bone growth. The main purpose of a 3D bone scaffold is to provide mechanical support to the surrounding cells and guide their growth in a specific direction. It acts as a template, encouraging the formation of new bone tissue by providing a framework for cells to attach, proliferate, and differentiate. These scaffolds are typically fabricated using biocompatible materials like ceramics, polymers, or a combination of both. The choice of material depends on factors such as strength, biodegradability, and the ability to facilitate cell adhesion and growth. Advanced techniques like 3D printing have revolutionized the fabrication process of these scaffolds. Using precise layer-by-layer deposition, it allows for the creation of complex, patient-specific geometries, mimicking the intricacies of natural bone structure. This article offers a brief overview of the latest developments in the research and development of 3D printing techniques for creating scaffolds used in bone tissue engineering.

38153404	Great effort has been made to encapsulate or coat living mammalian cells for a variety of applications ranging from diabetes treatment to three-dimensional printing. However, no study has reported the synthesis of a biomimetic bacterial capsule to display high-affinity aptamers on the cell surface for enhanced cell recognition. Therefore, we synthesized an ultrathin alginate-polylysine coating to display aptamers on the surface of living cells with natural killer (NK) cells as a model. The results show that this coating-mediated aptamer display is more stable than direct cholesterol insertion into the lipid bilayer. The half-life of the aptamer on the cell surface can be increased from less than 1.5 to over 20 h. NK cells coated with the biomimetic bacterial capsule exhibit a high efficiency in recognizing and killing target cells. Therefore, this work has demonstrated a promising cell coating method for the display of aptamers for enhanced cell recognition.

38145962	3D bioprinting has enabled the fabrication of tissue-mimetic constructs with freeform designs that include living cells. In the development of new bioprinting techniques, the controlled use of diffusion has become an emerging strategy to tailor the properties and geometry of printed constructs. Specifically, the diffusion of molecules with specialized functions, including crosslinkers, catalysts, growth factors, or viscosity-modulating agents, across the interface of printed constructs will directly affect material properties such as microstructure, stiffness, and biochemistry, all of which can impact cell phenotype. For example, diffusion-induced gelation is employed to generate constructs with multiple materials, dynamic mechanical properties, and perfusable geometries. In general, these diffusion-based bioprinting strategies can be categorized into those based on inward diffusion (i.e., into the printed ink from the surrounding air, solution, or support bath), outward diffusion (i.e., from the printed ink into the surroundings), or diffusion within the printed construct (i.e., from one zone to another). This review provides an overview of recent advances in diffusion-based bioprinting strategies, discusses emerging methods to characterize and predict diffusion in bioprinting, and highlights promising next steps in applying diffusion-based strategies to overcome current limitations in biofabrication.

38112236	Anisotropic materials formed by living organisms possess remarkable mechanical properties due to their intricate microstructure and directional freedom. In contrast, human-made materials face challenges in achieving similar levels of directionality due to material and manufacturability constraints. To overcome these limitations, an approach using 3D printing of self-assembling thermotropic liquid crystal polymers (LCPs) is presented. Their high stiffness and strength is granted by nematic domains aligning during the extrusion process. Here, a remarkably wide range of Young's modulus from 3 to 40 GPa is obtained by utilizing directionality of the nematic flow the printing process.   By determining a relationship between stiffness, nozzle diameter, and line width, a design space where shaping and mechanical performance can be combined is identified. The ability to print LCPs with on-the-fly width changes to accommodate arbitrary spatially varying directions is demonstrated. This unlocks the possibility to manufacture exquisite patterns inspired by fluid dynamics with steep curvature variations. Utilizing the synergy between this path-planning method and LCPs, functional objects with stiffness and curvature gradients can be 3D-printed, offering potential applications in lightweight sustainable structures embedding crack-mitigation strategies. This method also opens avenues for studying and replicating intricate patterns observed in nature, such as wood or turbulent flow using 3D printing.	3D Printing of Flow-Inspired Anisotropic Patterns with Liquid Crystalline Polymers.	2024	Mar	Houriet Caroline;Damodaran Vinay;Mascolo Chiara;Gantenbein Silvan;Peeters Daniël;Masania Kunal	additive manufacturing;bio-inspired materials;gradients;liquid crystal polymers;mechanical anisotropy;toughening		Advanced materials (Deerfield Beach, Fla.)

38071898	Predicting ecological responses to rapid environmental change has become one of the greatest challenges of modern biology. One of the major hurdles in forecasting these responses is accurately quantifying the thermal environments that organisms experience. The distribution of temperatures available within an organism's habitat is typically measured using data loggers called operative temperature models (OTMs) that are designed to mimic certain properties of heat exchange in the focal organism. The gold standard for OTM construction in studies of terrestrial ectotherms has been the use of copper electroforming which creates anatomically accurate models that equilibrate quickly to ambient thermal conditions. However, electroformed models require the use of caustic chemicals, are often brittle, and their production is expensive and time intensive. This has resulted in many researchers resorting to the use of simplified OTMs that can yield substantial measurement errors. 3D printing offers the prospect of robust, easily replicated, morphologically accurate, and cost-effective OTMs that capture the benefits but alleviate the problems associated with electroforming. Here, we validate the use of OTMs that were 3D printed using several materials across eight lizard species of different body sizes and living in habitats ranging from deserts to tropical forests. We show that 3D printed OTMs have low thermal inertia and predict the live animal's equilibration temperature with high accuracy across a wide range of body sizes and microhabitats. Finally, we developed a free online repository and database of 3D scans (https://www.3dotm.org/) to increase the accessibility of this tool to researchers around the world and facilitate ease of production of 3D printed models. 3D printing of OTMs is generalizable to taxa beyond lizards. If widely adopted, this approach promises greater accuracy and reproducibility in studies of terrestrial thermal ecology and should lead to improved forecasts of the biological impacts of climate change.	3D printed models are an accurate, cost-effective, and reproducible tool for quantifying terrestrial thermal environments.	2024	Jan	Alujević Karla;Bakewell Leah;Clifton Ian T;Cox Christian L;Frishkoff Luke O;Gangloff Eric J;Garcia-Costoya Guillermo;Gifford Matthew E;Glenwinkel Madison;Gulati Samir A K;Head Alyssa;Miles Monica;Pettit Ciara;Watson Charles M;Wuthrich Kelly L;Logan Michael L	3D printing;Biophysical model;Climate change;OTM;Open database;Operative temperature model;Thermal physiology;Thermoregulation	Animals;Body Temperature Regulation;Cost-Benefit Analysis;Reproducibility of Results;Body Temperature;Temperature;Ecosystem;Lizards;Printing, Three-Dimensional	Journal of thermal biology	Department of Biology and Program in Ecology, Evolution, and Conservation Biology, University of Nevada, Reno, NV, 89557, USA.

38062998	Three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting, a promising advancement in tissue engineering technology, involves the robotic, layer-by-layer additive biofabrication of functional 3D tissue and organ constructs. This process utilizes biomaterials, typically hydrogels and living cells, following digital models. Traditional tissue engineering uses a classic triad of living cells, scaffolds, and physicochemical signals in bioreactors. A scaffold is a temporary, often biodegradable, support structure. Tissue engineering primarily falls into two categories: (i) scaffold based and (ii) scaffold free. The latter, scaffold-free 3D bioprinting, is gaining increasing popularity. Organ building blocks (OBB), capable of self-assembly and self-organization, such as tissue spheroids, organoids, and assembloids, have begun to be utilized in scaffold-free bioprinting. This article discusses the expanding range of OBB, presents the rapidly evolving collection of bioprinting and bioassembly methods using these OBB, and finally, outlines the advantages, challenges, and future perspectives of using OBB in organ printing.

38049232	Copper ion (Cu2+) is not only a transition metal ion but also a significant environmental pollutant. The imbalance of Cu2+ content will threaten the safety of the environment and even life. The portable detection devices based on ratiometric fluorescent probes have garnered increasing attention and acclaim because of their reliable analysis parameters. Therefore, two Cu2+ ratiometric fluorescent probes (RH-1 and RH-2) were developed, which exhibit pronounced fluorescence changes, high sensitivity, excellent selectivity, and large Stokes shift. Both probes are capable of detecting Cu2+ in water and milk samples. It is worth noting that a 3D-printed fluorescence sensing device was constructed using RH-1, and a new 3D-printed copper ion detection kit was developed based on RH-2, enabling on-the-spot estimation of Cu2+ concentration. These devices significantly facilitate Cu2+ detection in daily life. RH-2 has been successfully employed for imaging Cu2+ in living cells and zebrafish. In conclusion, this work provides, for the first time, the 3D-printed ideal tools for detecting Cu2+.

37851509	Engineered living materials (ELMs) are a novel class of functional materials that typically feature spatial confinement of living components within an inert polymer matrix to recreate biological functions. Understanding the growth and spatial configuration of cellular populations within a matrix is crucial to predicting and improving their responsive potential and functionality. Here, this work investigates the growth, spatial distribution, and photosynthetic productivity of eukaryotic microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (C. reinhardtii) in three-dimensionally shaped hydrogels in dependence of geometry and size. The embedded C. reinhardtii cells photosynthesize and form confined cell clusters, which grow faster when located close to the ELM periphery due to favorable gas exchange and light conditions. Taking advantage of location-specific growth patterns, this work successfully designs and prints photosynthetic ELMs with increased CO2 capturing rate, featuring high surface to volume ratio. This strategy to control cell growth for higher productivity of ELMs resembles the already established adaptations found in multicellular plant leaves.

37805917	The sophisticated and complex haptonastic movements in response to environmental-stimuli of living organisms have always fascinated scientists. However, how to fundamentally mimic the sophisticated hierarchical architectures of living organisms to provide the artificial counterparts with similar or even beyond-natural functions based on the underlying mechanism remains a major scientific challenge. Here,  liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) artificial tendrils showing evolutionary biomimetic locomotion are developed following the structure-function principle that is used in nature to grow climbing plants. These elaborately designed tendril-like LCE actuators possess an asymmetric core-sheath architecture which shows a higher-to-lower transition in the degree of LC orientation from the sheath-to-core layer across the semi-ellipse cross-section. Upon heating and cooling, the LCE artificial tendril can undergo reversible tendril-like shape-morphing behaviors, such as helical coiling/winding, and perversion. The fundamental mechanism of the helical shape-morphing of the artificial tendril is revealed by using theoretical models and finite element simulations. Besides, the incorporation of metal-ligand coordination into the LCE network provides the artificial tendril with reconfigurable shape-morphing performances such as helical transitions and rotational deformations. Finally, the abilities of helical and rotational deformations are integrated into a new reprogrammed flagellum-like architecture to perform evolutionary locomotion mimicking the haptonastic movements of the natural flagellum.

37680065	Conductive hydrogels are promising materials with mixed ionic-electronic conduction to interface living tissue (ionic signal transmission) with medical devices (electronic signal transmission). The hydrogel form factor also uniquely bridges the wet/soft biological environment with the dry/hard environment of electronics. The synthesis of hydrogels for bioelectronics requires scalable, biocompatible fillers with high electronic conductivity and compatibility with common aqueous hydrogel formulations/resins. Despite significant advances in the processing of carbon nanomaterials, fillers that satisfy all these requirements are lacking. Herein, intrinsically dispersible acid-crystalized PEDOT:PSS nanoparticles (ncrys-PEDOTX ) are reported which are processed through a facile and scalable nonsolvent induced phase separation method from commercial PEDOT:PSS without complex instrumentation. The particles feature conductivities of up to 410 S cm-1 , and when compared to other common conductive fillers, display remarkable dispersibility, enabling homogeneous incorporation at relatively high loadings within diverse aqueous biomaterial solutions without additives or surfactants. The aqueous dispersibility of the ncrys-PEDOTX particles also allows simple incorporation into resins designed for microstereolithography without sonication or surfactant optimization; complex biomedical structures with fine features (< 150 µm) are printed with up to 10% particle loading . The ncrys-PEDOTX particles overcome the challenges of traditional conductive fillers, providing a scalable, biocompatible, plug-and-play platform for soft organic bioelectronic materials.

37463509	Assistive devices are designed to enhance individuals with disabilities' functional abilities. The rise of 3D printing technology enabled the production of individualized assistive devices (IADs). A REHAB-LAB is intended for IAD provision involving technical referents and occupational therapists. This study aimed to develop the REHAB-LAB logic model; to explore its fidelity and desirability; and to explore the characteristics of arising initiatives of IAD production. The REHAB-LAB logic model development involved stakeholders throughout the research process. A pragmatic multimethod approach followed two phases 1) logic model development and 2) exploration of its fidelity and desirability. The REHAB-LAB logic model presented the resources (equipment, space, human) required to implement IAD provision in a rehabilitation center, and the expected deliverables (activities and outputs). The REHAB-LAB logic model highlights the interdisciplinarity of IAD provision including occupational therapists, doctors, engineers, managers, and technical referents and places the users at the center of the IAD production. Results confirmed the fidelity and desirability of the REHAB-LAB logic model. The REHAB-LAB logic model can be used as a reference for future healthcare organizations wishing to implement an IAD provision. This research highlighted the interest of IAD provision based on the REHAB-LAB model involving users and transdisciplinary practices.
